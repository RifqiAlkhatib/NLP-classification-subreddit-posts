,AskSocialScience,"Recently a friend sent me an [Article](http://womanmeanssomething.com/transition-as-treatment-the-best-studies-show-the-worst-outcomes/) after I asked them about their opinion on transgender issues. Needless to say, it concerned me. The article seems to imply that most studies that support transitioning and clinical treatment for transgender people take place over short periods of time, have high rates of people not following up, and that those that go for longer and have more follow-up speak against the effectiveness of the treatment. They claim that the results show a [Honeymoon period](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19040622/) for transgender people, and cite [Nobili 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11154-018-9459-y) that lists only 2 of 29 studies as high quality.

The most important studies they detail are as follows.

**Low Quality Studies**

[Ruppin &amp; Pfafflin 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690443): This is named as an example of a study that loses several people to follow-up.

[Lindqvist 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00238-016-1252-0): In addition to low follow-up, they claim that SF-36 data indicates that the author's explanations for the drop-off in physical and mental components as being applicable to the general population are wrong.

**High Quality Studies**

[Asscheman 2011 (Netherlands)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266549): “total mortality was 51% higher than in the general population, mainly from increased mortality rates due to suicide, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cardiovascular disease, drug abuse, and unknown cause.”

[Dhejne 2011 (Sweden)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885): They acknowledge the drop-off in suicide in the 1989-2003 cohort, but dismiss this on the basis of other studies that speak to the contrary. 

[Rauchfleish 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9789272) [Lindemalm 1986](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542412) and  [Simonsen 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479779): All are listed despite their acknowledged low sample size.

[Adams 2017](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/trgh.2016.0036): “It seems counterintuitive, on the other hand, that suicide attempts are lower before transition (ideation 36.1%; attempt 13.1%) than over most other periods (past year attempts being the exception).”

 [Jellestad 2018 (Switzerland)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/8684625/): ""found not only a lower mental quality of life for the surgically-transitioned group than the general population, but that neither hormone treatment nor surgery predicted positive quality of life.""

[Auer 2013 (Germany)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078469): ""investigated a hormone treated clinical group, and in comparison with a control group found “significantly higher mean scores in all psychopathology subscales”, no matter which sex was used as comparison. ""

,AskSocialScience,"I don't feel like I have a hard time understanding any of [Geert Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions theory](https://geerthofstede.com), except for this specific dimension. It was originally called Masculinity, or the gamut of masculinity—femininity. Hofstede and his followers, though, took pains to warn readers that this variable was not a reliable indicator of women's freedom relative to men's in that culture. From what I can gather, there is some correlation to that culture's socially acceptable gender roles, but it's not simple or direct. Some Hofstedians have attempted to rename this variable to ease confusion. I've seen ""quantity-of-life cultures vs. quality-of-life cultures"" and ""task-oriented vs. people-oriented"" suggested.

That helps a bit, but a question I have is, how is MAS an independent variable? I haven't done the math to back this up and am mediocre at statistics, but I hypothesize that high MAS is actually just a product of moderate-to-high individualism (INV), moderate-to-high power distance (PDI), and moderate to high indulgence (IND). Find me a culture that's high on all these but low on MAS, and I'll eat my crow-feathered hat.

I'll take a stab at *my* sense of what MAS means in layman's terms. Please attack it; I'd like to learn something:
In cultures that score high on MAS, it is incumbent upon all males, and optional for females, to cultivate a mindset and life attitude befitting a capable hunter or warrior. There are fewer social limits on the strategic use of harm to achieve one's aims. People aim to objectively outrank each other on hard metrics, rather than aiming to subjectively feel better as a primary end. Inequality is to be expected, as a natural product of competition, which itself is natural and good. It's a dog-eat-dog world, and who has more power than whom is the only real, objective measure of who has played the game of life better, on the level of one's social circle or the whole world just the same.
In low MAS cultures, by contrast, subjective wellbeing — being at peace with oneself and at peace with the world around oneself — is the primary goal, rather than a hoped-for secondary outcome of more objective, fact-based societal metrics. In low MAS cultures, it is incumbent upon all people, male and female, to be highly in tune with their own needs, and the needs of those around them, and be shrewd about when and what to contribute toward the greater good.

,AskSocialScience,"Hello!

First, to define *plural people*, is heard people who live in a *system* of several *alters*, occupying the same physical body.   
Clinically, that can refer to Dissociative Identity Disorder, or to other dissociative troubles.   
Non-clinically, it may refer to anyone who sees themselves having multiple *alters*/*""personalities""/headmates*, for a large amount of reasons, for example culture, religion (see *tulpamancy*), or even just 'it feels natural' (see *paromancy*).

Most of the studies I can find go very deeply into the clinical side, reasons DID exists and interactions with other troubles (eg ASD, schizophrenia, ...), but don't really aboard the simplest side of 'everyday life', how an individual living as a system is impacted during social life (work, relationships, etc etc).  
An evident impact would be the gender of such an individual, which might be the gender of the *main alter*, or a combination of everything, or something else. I already couldn't find any sort of study simply talking of the gender of these plural individuals (*this wording sounds odd, right?*).

My question mainly regards:   
\- What are studies that have been made regarding non-clinical plural people? What sort of tools have people used to observe this situation?  
\- Are there studies that have been conducted specifically on transgender and/or non-binary plural individuals, clinically or not?

This is probably an extremely specific topic, and I have been asked to take it mainly on the social side, rather than the clinical side ; this point here is the reason of most of my struggles searching for information.

&lt;p&gt;Most of the studies I can find go very deeply into the clinical side, reasons DID exists and interactions with other troubles (eg ASD, schizophrenia, ...), but don&amp;#39;t really aboard the simplest side of &amp;#39;everyday life&amp;#39;, how an individual living as a system is impacted during social life (work, relationships, etc etc).&lt;br/&gt;
An evident impact would be the gender of such an individual, which might be the gender of the &lt;em&gt;main alter&lt;/em&gt;, or a combination of everything, or something else. I already couldn&amp;#39;t find any sort of study simply talking of the gender of these plural individuals (&lt;em&gt;this wording sounds odd, right?&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question mainly regards:&lt;br/&gt;
- What are studies that have been made regarding non-clinical plural people? What sort of tools have people used to observe this situation?&lt;br/&gt;
- Are there studies that have been conducted specifically on transgender and/or non-binary plural individuals, clinically or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably an extremely specific topic, and I have been asked to take it mainly on the social side, rather than the clinical side ; this point here is the reason of most of my struggles searching for information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for any answer you might have.&lt;/p&gt;

Rugby Football Union which invited individuals, including three
members of the club to join the tour. There were two views
about the tour amongst the opponents of apartheid. The view
taken by the council, a view which I share, was that the tour
would endorse the racist policies of the South African Government.
The opposite view was expressed by Mr. Dodge, who was one of
the three members of the club who participated in the tour and
who gave sworn evidence in these proceedings as follows:

&gt;&gt;""I personally deplore apartheid as being morally wrong. It is
nevertheless **my genuine belief that maintaining sporting
links with South Africa does help break down the evil social
barriers of apartheid**, a personal belief which has been
strengthened by observing in 1984 the improvement since
1980.""

Government had subscribed to the Gleneagles agreement but did
not take steps to ban the tour, leaving the decision to each
individual invited to take part. The club does not practice racial
discrimination, does not support apartheid, has not been guilty of
any infringement of the Race Relations Act 1976, did not support
the decision of the three members to join the tour and sought to
discourage them from joining the tour by sending them copies of
the reasoned memorandum published by the opponents of the tour.
The council does not contend that the club should have threatened
or punished the three club members who participated in the tour

**Extremely Long Version:**

I'm currently conducting research on behalf if this [organization](https://snfpaideia.upenn.edu/initiatives/red-and-blue-exchange/).  We're hoping to ""build a movement"" of young people across the country who are interested in cross-party civil dialogue. While it's somewhat easy to find folks in any college who are interested in these tough discussions, it's quite difficult to keep them all informed and all discussing the best ways to engage folks who are actually there to argue.

It turns out, there's a science (very young and constantly developing science)  to engaging with others who don't share your opinion. As we continue to conduct research in this field and continue to learn from other folks trying it out, we need a way to share best practices, resources, etc. We also need a way to let others share their challenges, their successes, and so on.

It occurs to me that many professionals (doctors, scientists, etc.) might already be working in online communities they can share ideas, discuss ideas, perhaps even argue about ideas, but ultimately use as a resource to improve their work. I'm especially interested in how you connect with very niche concepts- for example, ""Race and Privilege"" is fairly well-trodden and likely easy to seek out new ideas. ""Race and Privilege in McDonald's playgrounds,"" however is much less common and, thus, anyone concerned with just that, must have a way to connect to the other few people studying it?

Any thoughts? Any links to well-designed online communities that are there to promote dialogue?

,AskSocialScience,"\[Edit: I meant ""Middle East and South Asia"" rather than ""the developing world"". Muslims in the Balkans and Central Asia (which *are* part of the developing world) are overwhelmingly secular.\]

This [2013 Pew poll](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) about world Muslim opinion of religion, politics and society offers an insight into the modern Islamic world. First of all: Do the poll's methodology, presentation and conclusion generally appear sound to you?

According to that poll, adopting sharia enjoys a great deal of popularity among Muslims outside of Europe and Central Asia, especially in the Middle East and South Asia where support is almost universal — though most agree it should only apply to Muslims. Still, a significant amount of Muslims supports the death penalty for apostasy (i.e. conversion from Islam) especially in Malaysia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine among countries polled.

And yet... When Muslims were asked if they valued religious freedom and the ability of non-Muslims to practice openly, 76% was the *lowest* recorded approval rate — with most over 90%. Moreover, when Muslims were asked if they thought targeting civilians was sometimes justified, 40% was the *highest* recorded approval rate — with most well below 30%. That's less than the \~55% approval rate recorded among Americans in a [2010 Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx).

Support for the execution of apostates *in spite of* general interfaith tolerance seems like a jarring juxtaposition to me. Is this a recent development related to the rise of Islamism in the '80s, or does it have deeper roots in regional history? I am reasonably familiar with Cold War-era MENA politics and I had never even come across the issue before — what was hot stuff back then was secular pan-Arabism, not murdering heretics.

,AskSocialScience," I dont know if this question goes here, but here it goes.

The  subject is that recently I've been thinking about this question, and I  got to some positive points and some negatives. So I would like to know  what other people think about it.

Also, this is about all porn: staged, amateur, homemade, hentai, etc. It is all related through websites, ads and interests after all.

The positives:

Porn  media help to normalize sexuality, wich is a toxic taboo in our  society, because can, and do, make people feel bad, ashame, etc, about  something that is natural and normal. Only this can be its own topic so  I'm letting it there.

Studies have  shown that porn consumition decreases sexual assaults. I havent seem  much of this matter, but I've seen this affimation in several pages. If I  recall correctly It has to do with sexual impulses being released  through porn instead of the real thing.

The negatives:

Porn  is not something that isn't fully regulated, as almost everything on  the internet, but with porn things get a little more intense. It can be  cases of people dragged to the world of porn filming, against their  will, totally or partially.

It can  even be seen as a form of the problem of prostitution, where people get  in a situation where they cant get out, and find themselves trapped and  you could say even enslaved.

Also there is the case of pornographic content of people upload against their will.

All of this is very aggravated by how sex is something very intimate in our society

My conclusions:

Maybe  the consumition of porn would help destroy the taboo. This could help  to make it more a regulated thing, a less obscure part of the internet.  It could also help to  diminish the type of enslavery I talked about,  and also, it would be less of an intimate thing, wich would make all  kind of sexual aggresion less painful (I'm talking about what I already  said but also all kinds of it).

In  the other hand just not consuming that type of content would simply  diminish the demand, and so, the problems that comes with it, but maybe  the more obscure the matter becomes the worst.

So  here I am, I think this is a real problem for some people and I would  like do the right thing, even if it just helps a little.",t2_pqjh1,False,,0,False,Is consuming pornography good or bad for society?,[],r/AskSocialScience,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lpwqlz,False,dark,0.83,,public,52,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,52,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614049322.0,text,6,,,text,self.AskSocialScience,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont know if this question goes here, but here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  subject is that recently I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this question, and I  got to some positive points and some negatives. So I would like to know  what other people think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this is about all porn: staged, amateur, homemade, hentai, etc. It is all related through websites, ads and interests after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porn  media help to normalize sexuality, wich is a toxic taboo in our  society, because can, and do, make people feel bad, ashame, etc, about  something that is natural and normal. Only this can be its own topic so  I&amp;#39;m letting it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have  shown that porn consumition decreases sexual assaults. I havent seem  much of this matter, but I&amp;#39;ve seen this affimation in several pages. If I  recall correctly It has to do with sexual impulses being released  through porn instead of the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porn  is not something that isn&amp;#39;t fully regulated, as almost everything on  the internet, but with porn things get a little more intense. It can be  cases of people dragged to the world of porn filming, against their  will, totally or partially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can  even be seen as a form of the problem of prostitution, where people get  in a situation where they cant get out, and find themselves trapped and  you could say even enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there is the case of pornographic content of people upload against their will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is very aggravated by how sex is something very intimate in our society&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe  the consumition of porn would help destroy the taboo. This could help  to make it more a regulated thing, a less obscure part of the internet.  It could also help to  diminish the type of enslavery I talked about,  and also, it would be less of an intimate thing, wich would make all  kind of sexual aggresion less painful (I&amp;#39;m talking about what I already  said but also all kinds of it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In  the other hand just not consuming that type of content would simply  diminish the demand, and so, the problems that comes with it, but maybe  the more obscure the matter becomes the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So  here I am, I think this is a real problem for some people and I would  like do the right thing, even if it just helps a little.&lt;/p&gt;

,AskSocialScience,"So I was reading a recent WSJ Op-Ed, and they made a pretty interesting claim regarding the Quality of Life disparities between white and black people. The list (as I remember it) goes as follows:

\-Black kids used to have higher GPAs out of high school than their white peers, but they have since fallen and are no longer ahead.

\-The black-white income disparity has widened.

\-The black-white college attendance disparity has widened.

The article, without evidence or substantiation, claims that this is due to the government interfering with everyday life, as it is framed around author and professor Shelby Steele, a black conservative who firmly believes government intervention is preventing equality from being achieved. While I'm open to new ideas, I also believe such ideas require substantiation, and, at least in this particular piece, such is absent.

**1-Coach with basic knowledge of a language** will go out to a neighborhood where there are lots of people who speak that foreign language. 

2-**The Coach will film himself talking to the foreign people.** The unfamiliar people are either paid actors or willing participants. The Coach shock the people with his ""scripted"" speech.

3-**The Coach will upload his video to a social media platform with strong buzzwords**, 'shocking! Average guy speaks perfect X foreign language.""

4- The naive people on the comments will sign up for lessons or buy the 'digital course.""

**5-Most of the material turns out to be basic language training** for beginners. Half the people will not complain and accept whatever the coach tells them, sign up for more lessons or buy more courses. 

**6-The another half will complain and write negative reviews**. The Coach will say, ""They are haters,"" or ""They are jealous of his success,"" or ""they didn't put in the work.""Most of the native audience will defend the Coach and justify his action. Very few will take ""legal action.""

2-**Student**: Sure, I'll give it. Try! Although academics say, that language learning might take much longer.

3-**Language Coach**: Don't listen to academics; they don't know what they are talking about. I have this new method that I've devised. 

**4-Student signs up for lessons:** they end up being subpar or the coach makes his ""intern"" teach the lesson. 

**5- The student asks for a refund, yet he is not granted one**. Instead, the coach doesn't bother and won't answer the calls.

6- Most students give up on the refund on their own. Simultaneously, the minority who doesn't is 'shamed"" by their friends and family were ""fools"" for believing the coach. Eventually, the minority also lets it go after writing a bad review.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1-&lt;strong&gt;Language Coach&lt;/strong&gt;: I promise you I can get you to learn French in 30 days, or otherwise you&amp;#39;ll get your money back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2-&lt;strong&gt;Student&lt;/strong&gt;: Sure, I&amp;#39;ll give it. Try! Although academics say, that language learning might take much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3-&lt;strong&gt;Language Coach&lt;/strong&gt;: Don&amp;#39;t listen to academics; they don&amp;#39;t know what they are talking about. I have this new method that I&amp;#39;ve devised. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4-Student signs up for lessons:&lt;/strong&gt; they end up being subpar or the coach makes his &amp;quot;intern&amp;quot; teach the lesson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- The student asks for a refund, yet he is not granted one&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, the coach doesn&amp;#39;t bother and won&amp;#39;t answer the calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6- Most students give up on the refund on their own. Simultaneously, the minority who doesn&amp;#39;t is &amp;#39;shamed&amp;quot; by their friends and family were &amp;quot;fools&amp;quot; for believing the coach. Eventually, the minority also lets it go after writing a bad review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7- The Government,&lt;/strong&gt; by and large, doesn&amp;#39;t get involved, and it seems like it isn&amp;#39;t one of their priorities to regulate these industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8-It seems that the only ones who &amp;quot;complain&amp;quot; are the other language teachers who accuse the others of being fake.&lt;/p&gt;

I am wondering if there anyone can point me towards some research on the effects of exposure to parental sexual expressiveness on younger children/adolescents.

I am thinking of parents whose social media accounts combine personal forms of sexual expression (but perhaps not activity), such as twerking, participating in tik tok trends which highlight sexual dance moves, posting pictures that highlight and accentuate one's body in a sexual manner, etc. where this activity would presumably be visible to the child or even done in their presence.

Would also take literature where the sexuality is more overt, such as bringing sexual partners into the home, or participating in sex work, around children/adolescents.

I mean to distnguish between expressions of care and affection between parents, versus forms of sexual expression directed toward other people who the child does not know (online viewers, non-committal sexual partners, etc.)

Also curious, more generally, on literature that examines effects of children being exposed to their parents' sexual natures more generally (hearing/accidentally seeing parents having sex, finding toys/condoms, etc.)

,AskSocialScience,"Hi all

I live in South Africa, and with the zombie apocalypse, our government shut down the sale of alcohol as soon as COVID peaks here every time. The reason they provide is that South Africans have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and that we overload our public health system with alcohol related injuries which leaves little space for people suffering from COVID.

My argument (Without any evidence, which is why I’m here.)  is that South African have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol as a result of the old laws that’s been around since we got independence from England in the 30s.

Before the 30s South Africa was an English colony and as a result we have all these rules around alcohol sale times (we also have super constrictive laws about radio/tv frequency and in other industries ) which has been around since England made them looong ago.

I’ve had the privilege to travel throughout Asia, and the one thing that becomes very apparent to a South African was that you can buy alcohol at any 7Eleven at any time of the day and night. If there are people there who has a unhealthy relationship with alcohol they were few and far between and they didn't seem to have the same issues we have.

The second part of my argument puzzle is the way corporate companies treat their employees. This is something I have 1st hand experience in. Corporate companies tend to treat their employees like children. E.g. They will create teams, and then the team will have to come up with a name, and then compete with other teams. They will also hand out treats if you ""won” something, etc. It’s hard to explain, but if you’ve worked in a corporate you probably know what I’m talking about. You will also know that what this does is take all responsibility away from the employee, as they go straight into playground mode when they get treated like this for long enough.

So, to come back to my argument. I believe that the South African government is (maybe) unintentionally doing the same thing for years and years by not revising these laws. They treat South Africans as children, taking away their responsibility, to a degree, and then limiting their access to something they want. This causes, when the restrictions are lifted, that people go crazy when they access alcohol again which then bumps the hospital admissions and then causes a confirmation bias on the side of the government.

I’m 41 now and as long as I can remember alcohol laws have been this strict here. Without any COVID or national emergency, we can’t buy alcohol at a bottle store after 6 or 8pm (depends on how much money the liquor store was willing to fork out for a liquor license.) On Weekends this is earlier as well, with some liquor stores being closed on Sundays (also liquor license).

I’m sure a bunch of these UK laws are in place because it's a way for them to tax people who already pay tax, but at some point this will need to be resolved, so that we can move forward as adults and not children who're grounded.

,AskSocialScience,"**I'm going to say that it might be broad generalizations, but it's a phenomenon I've seen and wanted some clarification. I think something is going on with how different societies operate.**

**Observations**

**Some Latin American societies**: It seems people don't read and get their education from television. The people who read tend to be professors and the professors will publish their books mostly for other professors to read. It doesn't seem like a widespread practice that young people could publish a novel or book and get attention. 

**United States**: It's a vast country, almost like its own continent. The professors' case is similar in that maybe an associate professor will ""stick their neck out' and write their book, mostly for other professors to read it. To publish a political book seems like you need to have substantial evidence, and it looks like only Ph.D. grads will publish a book for a specialized journal at the end of their Ph.D. 

Given how huge the country is, even if a young person would publish their political book or novel, they would mostly be relegated to a niche. Maybe they'll have fans within that niche but might be unknown to the public at large. 

What I've seen is that the political class seems to have more connections with the business world as  opposed to the intellectual or academic world. Hence, you often don't see politicians talking about an abstract theory but rather trying to appeal to the masses.

**Argentina**(From what I've heard, France might have a similar culture) It seems that three things happen (I don't think this is unique to Argentinian society, but its the example I'm most familiar with);

1-There's a large number of people reading and publishing. This author Berliac said he decided to publish his book since everyone around him was publishing as well.

2-You, don't need to have a Ph.D. or be an associate professor for people to listen to what you have to say. This intellectual, Agustin Lange, was an undergraduate student when he published his political theory book, and people listen to him and even became popular.

3- What these public intellectuals read/say has more weight. Since there appears to be more of a connection between the political class and the intellectual class.

&gt;There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy… If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist.  

He defines racial inequity and equity: 
&gt; Racial inequity is when two or more racial groups are not standing on approximately equal footing. Here’s an example of racial inequity: 71 percent of White families lived in owner-occupied homes in 2014, compared to 45 percent of Latinx families and 41 percent of Black families. Racial equity is when two or more racial groups are standing on a relatively equal footing. An example of racial equity would be if there were relatively equitable percentages of all three racial groups living in owner-occupied homes in the forties, seventies, or, better, nineties.

He believes that ""...the only solution to racist discrimination is anti-racist discrimination"" and his fundamental definitions of racism and antiracism are: 

&gt;Racism is a powerful collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity and are substantiated by racist ideas. Antiracism is a powerful collection of antiracist policies that lead to racial equity and are substantiated by antiracist ideas.

1.  Is he correct in his assertion that racist policies made by racist policymakers lead to the perpetutation of racist ideas?

2.  Is his claim that every disparity between non-white and white populations a result of racist policies (I.e. prejudice and discrimination) correct? 

3.  Whether or not the above claim is true, is his proposed solution (i.e. anti-racist discrimination) the only solution to inequities between racial groups?

The premise is that if you put a bunch of lazy people together, a portion, like the pareto principle, will become more productive. Then take away the new workers, and the remaining lazies will also step up. Is this true for humans ?

He just speaks of to whom should things such as property and education belong to, but never about if force or not are used to accomplish it. It's very confusing.

1. Technologies have made people (in the developed world) live in a world of convenience. So many tasks (e.g. ordering food, paying bills, workplace insurance claims) can be done with a laptop or app on a smartphone.
2. A lot of apps make things convenient and are easy to use themselves due to good UX design (e.g. iPads, Websites, etc). When was the last time you needed to read an instruction manual to figure out how to operate something?
3. Government institutions (at least in Canada, and I theorize in North America as a whole) have not been able to harness technology effectively to make civic engagement convenient. By civic engagement I mean contacting your local representative, voting, taxes, dealing with legal institutions, and most government services (this varies from country to country so I kept it vague).
4. I think people have been conditioned to expect a certain standard of convenience and democratic institutions have not been able to provide that convenience (neither have authoritarian governments, but there is much less expectation of citizenship participation there). To me this has led to lower voter turnout and lower engagement with government representatives.

Sorry if this is a weird or dumb question. But I am wondering why sex is so taboo, yet as soon as a woman gets pregnant, it is common for her to take pictures of her pregnant belly and show it off on social media. Being pregnant and having a baby is considered ""beautiful"" and a ""miracle,"" yet we do not have the same positive emotions when we imagine that same couple engaging in the sexual act that created the baby. In fact, we cannot even talk about them having sex without the conversation becoming awkward or making people feel uncomfortable or ""gross."" Ejaculation, semen, orgasms, etc. cannot be talked about, yet without these things, the ""miracle"" of pregnancy would not exist. 

To me, it just doesn't make sense that pregnancy can be considered ""beautiful"" and you can show off your pregnant belly to the whole world, yet the sexual act itself is so taboo that you can hardly talk about it with anyone without the conversation becoming weird or awkward.

,AskSocialScience,"I was unsure of where to post this.

The reason I ask is quite simple. Whenever a discussion of communism comes up, people are quick to chime in that communism has killed x number of people, and I believe this argument is always put forward in bad faith.

Not because it is disingenuous or impractical to be concerned about such things, and not even because it is often historically inaccurate to a certain degree - but rather because this point is never given in the context that capitalism also, as a point of fact, has led to the unjust death of millions.

I think that any system of governance will invariably be unable to save everyone, so it is not out of idleness that we speculate on these matters - we have to be scientifically minded, with the goal of understanding how to better the lives of everyone.

But the question of how many people die due to capitalism is so difficult because of the nature of the free market. If you have so many different agents, corporating their desires and exerting their forces of political and financial power within markets --- this sort of bombastic dynamism of capital, then it becomes very difficult to follow causal nodes, and attribute any blame in a scientific manner.

There is a sort of inherent obscurantism behind the signaling economic agents under a capitalist framework. i.e., our ability to discern directly which market forces are causing poverty, imperial violence, genocide, and civil unrest --- is obstructed by how noisy/dynamic capital is.

Whereas with communism, and some related notions of 'planned' economies, faults in the distribution of labour and resources is much easier to delineate. The relations of production are not so various and dynamic, and in spirit are only meant to work within the one, primary relation - the people/the workers owning the means of production.

So while I think criticisms of communism are valid, they must be willing to bring those same criticisms and notions of virtue to bear upon capital, which they rarely ever do - which is why I think it is put forward in bad faith.

,AskSocialScience,"Title correction: ""how much"" not ""how"".

I have seen some apparent similarities between the cultures of Ancient Rome and ""conservative"" Latin America but I am unsure if I am projecting too much of the present onto the past.

I am also not sure how much of what I say applies to almost every culture on Earth.

The main areas of similarities I see are:

  1. Family
  2. Politics
  3. Legal system
  4. Economics

(Long text ahead that isn't necessary to understand my question)

In both cultures families include servants or maids. Until recently, it was common place for maids to sleep on their employers house for most of the week. Old buildings feature small bedrooms and small restrooms for maids near the ""service area"" (*área de serviço*, the place of the house where the laundry is done).

Also, family members are seen as sort of subjects of the head of the household.

Whenever the state wants to implement a rule that would restrict the powers of the head of the household they are usually opposed by a large number of people.

Recent examples include: workers rights for maids, child spanking ban, teaching of african culture and history, teaching of evolution, teaching of queer people.

This seems related to the idea that not everyone should have rights. Lower ranking people (e.g. poor, disabled, queer) should just ""accept"" when they are mistreated either by private or public agents.

The rank of a person seems to be related to how active/outdoorsy they are and how many people they command. ""No homo"" seems to apply if you top.

Both cultures have festivals in which said rules were broken: Saturnalia and Carnival.

In politics, both culture seem to revolve arround ""famous leaders"" and elections are an afterthought.

If someone doesn't vote the ""right way"" (i.e. poor people voting for leftist politicians) they are accused of ""not knowing how to vote"".

Political parties seem like mere fandoms instead of proper insitutions. People care a lot more about the individual politicians than ideology.

Scandals seem to only matter when political rivals do it. The hard core ""fans"" tolerate transgressions no matter what.

Politics seem to be reserved for the ""right people"" and when low ranking people try to be active in politics they are seen with distrust and as if they violating some sacred rule.

It seems that rank is inversely related to following rules and having high expections from others. If you are a ""low level worker"" people desire a lot from you (e.g. perfect and fast work) and get furious if you break even small rules. If you are a plantation owner, people don't really expect a lot from you and accept that you will break the rules.

When a high ranking person commits a crime, they usually find a way out of being punished while low rank people are jailed for crimes they didn't even commit.

Finally, both cultures seem to have economic systems with large class divide and based mostly on agriculture and extraction with relatively little industry. The entire system seems dependent on cheap unskilled labour.",t2_1oy24ohu,False,,0,False,"How ""culturally Roman"" is (conservative) Latin America?",[],r/AskSocialScience,False,6,,0,,False,t3_kst0dl,False,dark,0.47,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1610101588.0,text,6,,,text,self.AskSocialScience,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title correction: &amp;quot;how much&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;how&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

The following passage from Robin DiAngelo's *White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism* (2018) is representative:

&gt;As a sociologist, I am quite comfortable generalizing; social life is patterned and predictable in measurable ways. But I understand that my generalizations may cause some defensiveness for the white people about whom I am generalizing, given how cherished the ideology of individualism is in our culture.

We cannot understand modern forms of racism if we cannot or will not explore patterns of group behavior and their effects on individuals.

In the world of today, we live in an era of abundance and/or excess, with an advancement that is so fast-paced that the rate keeps on skyrocketing by the second.

In the world of today, things are much more accessible, available and more possible than ever:

* Things can be accessed, stored and transferred in the blink of an eye and the world of today is literally swimming in an ocean of information (which is why it is called the information era)
* With the technology and the level of understanding of many things today, things can be made in a short period of time – machines making thousands or even millions of products and pumping them out and great quantities
* And with the level of globalisation that we are in today, there are simultaneously many things and places around the world that are simultaneously expanding, advancing, producing, and doing and reacting in any way, place and form

This, of course, gives us a lot more room for variety and many things are of various degrees in quality, taste and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

But then you will realise something.

You go to a video game store like Steam or go on Netflix, or a library, and you see all of these options.

&amp;#x200B;

And to add to that, these lists often change as the algorithms are often updated, whether it is because of ongoing trends or things that fit in your recent activity or what you saw yesterday or better yet, what you did a Google search on yesterday or what you said on your smartphone microphone.

And to even add another thing to this, multiple things are often constantly being updated and/or advance as well – new TV episodes, sequels and prequels of stories, books, video games, or the current ongoing trends and discussions of every single fandom or news are constantly being updated like a Reddit thread that gets longer each time you refresh the page – then add that to multiple threads being extended … and to add another layer to this, sometimes the home page even changes so may not always get the same list of contents twice on the main page.

&amp;#x200B;

According to my understanding of human attention and memory, a human being can only do so much – we have a limited attention span, our minds (while very capable and versatile) is limited in their brainpower, and to switch and shift from one subject to another is not really an easy thing to do (imagine switching subjects in a school in a short amount of time), let alone having to go deeper within each subject and hoping that the level inside your brain, whether it is knowledge or mental skill or attention or understanding, increases as well which also takes time, effort and a lot of mental and physical attention.

It is as though we are given a lot of stuff that we can choose from like being in a candy store where there are also other kinds of candy stores and even other fancy stores around, where each one is filled to the prime with all kinds of delicacies and treats … but we can only buy or consume so much at a given rate, especially when we are told that these things may either get sold out or expire or die out because of changing trends.

It is like a bottleneck effect where we want to get all of the things and these things have a limited lifespan before their quality are deemed as good or relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you might say that this is all a thing in the mind and maybe so.

Perhaps this is all done via unconscious social means because of peer pressure and you are anxious to consume these things like everyone else is so that you do not miss out on the fun but you miss out on other things or not be as immersed because you are doing it because you are pressured to do so and not because you want to.

Or it could be a psychological issue because you have lots of interests and hobbies and needs but can only do so much at any given rate similar to having an 8-hour shift where the lists of tasks are either increasing or updating and so on. Let alone that we currently live in an era that we constantly bombarded with stimulation and/or the need for stimulation and information over and over and over again with that constant feed and need of dopamine without rest or pause.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - I think that this is a real issue in the world of today, whether it is video games, TV, film, art, books, education, news, etc because many of us have lots of interests, whether it is in multiple subjects like you could be an artist and a banker; and/or interests in multiple creative entities in a particular thing like you can be a fan of multiple franchises and fandoms.**

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is all done via unconscious social means because of peer pressure and you are anxious to consume these things like everyone else is so that you do not miss out on the fun but you miss out on other things or not be as immersed because you are doing it because you are pressured to do so and not because you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or it could be a psychological issue because you have lots of interests and hobbies and needs but can only do so much at any given rate similar to having an 8-hour shift where the lists of tasks are either increasing or updating and so on. Let alone that we currently live in an era that we constantly bombarded with stimulation and/or the need for stimulation and information over and over and over again with that constant feed and need of dopamine without rest or pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR - I think that this is a real issue in the world of today, whether it is video games, TV, film, art, books, education, news, etc because many of us have lots of interests, whether it is in multiple subjects like you could be an artist and a banker; and/or interests in multiple creative entities in a particular thing like you can be a fan of multiple franchises and fandoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I think that this is not only unhealthy for all of us but also something that is not talked about a lot or not discussed thoroughly on how to tackle this as the world keeps on advancing and producing and so on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What does social science have to say here?   

The answer might have policy implications.  America is increasingly supporting drug liberalization, e.g.,  [PBS: Push to relax drug laws gains big victories...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/future-voting-rights-marijuana-laws-at-stake-in-several-states).

No doubt, over-criminalization is a big problem; numerous sources discuss it, e.g.: [PBS: The Problem with “Broken Windows” Policing](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-broken-windows-policing/).

,AskSocialScience,"I feel like we, humans, treat age and history in the same regard. We believe that aging brings about wisdom. Sure, older people have more experiences and they might have seen more and met more people that doesn't mean they are smarter. Even when learning history, there is a sense that past events hold answers to current problems or that learning about the past prohibits us from making the same mistakes. There is also the assumption that we are more smarter now than we were before and that we can decipher the subliminal messages in the past from an elevated standpoint in the present.

Isn't this a grossly optimistic outlook? Hegel and other philosophers have, time and again, pointed out that history is not a trove of hidden answers. (Why I use Hegel is because he talks about history as a turnover of events, where the turnover is brought about by extremist practices of an ideology in that time period (ie Holocost was an extreme version of fascism; please correct me if I am wrong). Believing that the passage of time is accompanied by wisdom supposes that knowledge will eventually culminate into something, possibly the meaning of life with age or a utopian standard of living with history. This is really problematic, because neither have been proven yet.

So, how does this affect our daily lives? I think it is important to respect the elderly, but we should not romanticise their intellectual simply because they have lived long lives. We should reconfigure our perception of age. We should also change the way history is taught in school.

,AskSocialScience,"I originally made this post in another sub, but I didn’t get as much statistical data as I had hoped, and I wanted to get different takes on the topic. If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing (hopefully you at least read the important 
parts of it for the specific context of why I ask this question), skip to the last paragraph.

This post is a little bit all over the place, but let me give some background. My parents are Eritrean immigrants who came to the US in the mid to late eighties during Eritrea’s war with Ethiopia, and I was born in the US. Their general belief is that the social and economic oppression of a large portion of the working/lower class African American population in the US is the result of the characteristics of black “culture” (if there is  even such a thing as a unified African American culture) which promotes behaviors that allow them to be subjected to unfair treatment from other racial groups like white people. I don’t really have much of a viewpoint on this because I don’t believe I have the proper life experience to make that kind of judgement. Nevertheless, there is some dissonance in the subject that I would like to get some clarification on:

Many of our parents and family members in the Habesha community (Ethiopian/Eritrean community) came to the US as refugees during the eighties and nineties (some even as early as the seventies). A large number of them are not particularly educated, with many of them having fled their country from villages/rural areas. It is not uncommon for many of our parents to have never completed elementary school. Even from the small minority of those who were able to receive a university degree in their home country, their degrees are generally largely unusable in the US for employment purposes, and so their job prospects are similar to other refugees.

When they come here, they generally work minimum wage jobs, work under the table for cash, and live in low income housing. My understanding from what they tell us is that they work a lot and save up money (along with being on welfare of course) until they can move out of the low income housing, and then they find a wife/husband and have children somewhere else. If they want keep taking advantage of the low cost living, they remain in low income housing, get married, and have kids, and once the kids are old enough that they can be “influenced by the hood mentality” (their words), the parents are somehow able to take their kids and leave the neighborhood.

Despite this, our parents still work low income jobs and receive welfare benefits, but their kids enjoy a typical, middle class life. I don’t know the details of everyone’s finances, so I am unaware of how exactly they manage, but in the grand scheme, our families generally don’t face many unbearable financial hardships due to living in America. In addition, there is pressure for our parents to send money back to Africa for their parents/siblings/extended family and friends, which many (especially men) do quite often. But socioeconomically, they remain at the same status throughout their lives as refugees. In my neighborhood alone, there have always been around 5 to 10 taxi cabs sitting around, all owned and driven by Eritreans/Ethiopians, and that typically ends up being their livelihood until they stop working. Some woman stay at home to raise their children, while others work menial jobs to support the household.

Any kind of generational wealth for us is obviously non existent, and so it is in our family’s interest for us to “become successful” in our careers. Although our parents’ socioeconomic status has not and probably will not change in the US, the American born youth of the community has become quite successful, with many US born children having already received their PhDs and earning high salaries.

To white people and other non-African minorities, we appear as black. We still receive plenty of microaggression on account of our race. My father has been pulled over by the police numerous times when driving alone for matching certain suspicious profiles. My mother and I have been followed around in stores countless times and have been watched carefully by several employees at the checkout line. Even when passing by someone’s house at night in my neighborhood, there are some people who, instead of entering their house after exiting their car, stand by their front door and watch us until we pass by before opening their front door and entering their house. A lot of this behavior does come from other uneducated foreigners, but definitely not all of it. My mother has a English sounding last name, and so on paper, she is often mistaken for a white woman. When making doctors appointments, people’s tones immediately change once they hear that she has an accent. She recently wanted to buy a used car from someone, and when the lady who was selling it spoke to her (she was white), she became very nervous and kept asking whether or not the woman who had initially messaged her was really her (this woman had been very enthusiastic about selling my mother the car before this). The woman then kept asking my mother about where exactly she lived, how many kids she had, where she worked, and a bunch of other irrelevant questions, and she kept slowly trying to back out of the transaction. My mother was fully aware of what was happening, and she assured her that she didn’t have to sell if she didn’t want to, told her to have a nice day, and decided not to talk with her any further. Growing up, I took violin lessons, and in the first couple of lessons, my mother would come with me. The (white) teacher flat out told me to tell my mother she expected a regular check payment every month and that she “doesn’t like checks that bounce” (her exact words).

These are just a few of many experiences involving race that I have had growing up, but because my parents always had such a seemingly nonchalant attitude about it, I never learned to be offended by any of it. In fact,  my mother and I found it pretty hilarious most of the time.

TL;DR: I know it is unfair to make sweeping comparisons, but I have always been genuinely confused as to how related the “black American” experience is today for African Americans and for African refugees. Despite the humble beginnings of African refugees in America, it is my understanding that their first generation children in America end up rising above the status they grew up with. I don’t know too much about the Somali community, but from those I have known, their experiences seem to be similar. I am certain that there are a lot of holes in my knowledge, and so that’s why I wanted to ask reddit to clear up whatever ignorance and help me learn more. First of all, do children of African immigrants (specifically refugees) do better on average than African Americans economically, and if so, are there any concrete correlations that can be associated with this? Do they face similar systemic disadvantages? Is it easier for someone like me or my parents to not be offended by racist behavior/attitudes towards us?

([https://www.zillow.com/research/homeownership-gap-widens-19384/](https://www.zillow.com/research/homeownership-gap-widens-19384/))

I've seen this question used to deny that redlining (and other racist housing policies) had a meaningful impact on black wealth, and I don't currently have the social science background to know how to reconcile these phenomena. 

One explanation I've seen is that private lenders had the correct market incentives to lend to higher-income black applicants (because they could pay back their loans), and thus, private interests helped increase black homeownership despite explicitly racist government policy. Is this explanation supported by the empirical data? If not, what other explanations better reconcile the increase in black homeownership with racist housing policy? 

Another observation that confuses me is, since the introduction of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, racial disparities in homeownership rates don't seem to have budged much.

Abstract: This paper analyzes whether teachers’ attention to boys and girls differs in low-performing schools in Chile, where large gender gaps in test scores are also observed. We coded 237 videotaped classes of fourth graders, identifying specific behaviors of teachers toward boys and girls. **The results show a general imbalance in teachers’ attention and interactions favoring boys. Gender attention gap is correlated with lower scores in math for girls on Chile’s national standardized test (SIMCE).** The gender attention gap was also greater in general in classrooms in which teachers had overall worse interactions with students, as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). The evidence in this paper contributes to the discussion about whether traditional measures of teacher–student interactions really capture all that matters for learning.

After reading through the study, I first got the impression that teachers give unequal attention to boys and girls and this unequal treatment is an explanatory factor for the math score gap between the two sexes. The whole tone of the paper seems to suggest this. But **Table 9** seems to paint a different picture. Although gender bias is negatively correlated with girls' math performance, this negative correlation is even stronger for boys (regarding teacher-initiated actions). Ending the unequal treatment would possibly increase the gap instead of closing it.

Similar thing happened in the Netherlands, Latvia and Estonia - although historically predominantly Protestant they too had seen a drastic decline of Protestantism - so much so that today Catholicism is the largest religion in the Netherlands (down from 30% to 24% since the 1890s as opposed to Protestantism's decline from 65% to 15% in the same period. 50% are irreligious, as opposed to less than 5% in the 1890s) and Orthodoxy in Estonia and Latvia (share of Protestants was down from 80% (for Estonia) and 66% (in Latvia) in 1930s to 15% (in Estonia) in 2011 and 17% (in Latvia) in 2018. No data for Orthodoxy in 1930s, but it has seen increase from 13% to 16% from 2000 to 2011(in Estonia) and from 22% to 26% from 2000 to 2018 (in Latvia). Irreligion is at 55% in Estonia and 15% in Latvia. No data for prior irreligion rates apart from irreligion being less than 20% in Estonia in 1930s). In all cases irreligion steadily increased which seems to offer correlation (although not definitive causation as this is all the data i have) between the rise in irreligious membership and decline in Protestant membership. But same correlation could be found in rise of non-Protestant religions and decline in Protestant ones (share of non-protestant religious people in Denmark, for example, increased from 5% to 15% within 60 years and from 5% to 10% within 130 years in the Netherlands) but i have no immigration records of any of these countries to determine how much of loss of Protestant membership is actually attributed to Protestants converting to other religions. One thing that might hint towards *this* causation is the fact that both Estonia and Latvia saw decrease in Orthodox minorities during the same period when Orthodoxy was on the rise in terms of numbers and percentage-wise (although reasons for this phenomenon could be manyfold and not necessarily hinting towards Protestant conversion to Orthodoxy)

Also, in all 6 cases dominant form of Protestantism was Calvinism (in the Netherlands) and Lutheranism (all other countries), so maybe that plays a more definitive role instead of Protestantism as a whole?

I have carried out a survey for my research study. Most questions were open ended for qualitative analysis, but a few were closed questions with the hope of presenting in descriptive manner with  basic statistics (pie charts and bar charts) to illustrate my respondents demographics.

Is it still appropriate to present my respondents demographic categories in pie charts with so few respondents in one group? It is part of the study’s aim, but having doubts due to the low numbers. 

Question 2 - I missed a detail when configuring the survey to my question ”How often do you make online purchases per month?” so instead responding single numbers a lot of respondents wrote ”1-3”, ”3”, ”5-7”, ”3-5” and so on. I was thinking of dividing them into categories like 0-2 and 3-5 but since they overlap I am having issues here. Is there any good solution to handling this to present this data clearly?

2. Assuming pop. growth is negatively associated with QoL, can a nation with a declining population make up for lost growth with improved health outcomes?

This question is weird so I fully acknowledge I may not get a straight answer, but I was curious as to if the declines in population are in anyway offset or even surpassed by improvements to quality of life, and health outcomes is the only metric that I was aware of that came to mind.

,AskSocialScience,"Hi,

Basically I'm feeling a bit downhearted. 

I've heard some people argue with me that moderate social progress even in the direction of a swedish welfare state allegeldy leads to authoritarian dictatorships or authoritarian socialism. I've heard that any reform like a progressive tax just creates capital flight and leaves a country without any manufacturing base and that the world can only exist how it does now otherwise it will be a horrible dictatorial place.

Now naturally I don't believe that but then the question inevitably arises what makes some reforms work and what makes some reforms more authoritarian.

For example the state in my country runs the healthcare system, its completely nationalised but its not authoritarian in any sense, likewise the broadcast media but its not authoritarian. Is it only authoritarian if its a monopoly? But then there are several european countries which have nationalised natural monopolies and there not authoritarian.

I know my questions a bit jumbled but I guess the route of it is that surely all social progress starts of with a policy proposal that is utopian, and at some point youve got to throw caution to the wind to see if it works.

,AskSocialScience,"This post is a rant. 

There has been a slew of such questions on this sub lately with half informed or just garbage questions in the aforementioned format. Yeah right, the US Pres elections just got over and you might be thinking about it along (such) simplistic lines, and I understand the curiosity too; but please try to search the answers first on the sub or just look up online. Most of these questions are actually worth a PhD thesis and can’t be understood in a simplistic way — since they are highly intertwined with the geopolitical, socioeconomic, gender issues, and traditions/histories of the region. Some of the questions are just offensive (the premise of the questions being discriminatory in the first place). 

A request to the Mods to look into the matter if they feel it’s as important as I think it is.

,AskSocialScience,"Hello,

I recently saw a post about people rightfully complaining about racism in fifa, where some people would create offensive characters with black skin, caricatural facial features, and stereotyped african names.

Going from this thread, this made wonder about character creation as a whole in the past few days. When creating an avatar for a game, it can be argued that our intentions can reflect some stereotypes or conceptions that we have about certain people. Let's say that If test subjects were to play as an attractive character, the created avatar facial features could be an objective measurement of their subjective conception of beauty.

Going forward, when people play RPG and want to RP as a character with a certain personnality, eg : a thief, a mage, a succesful merchant, or whatever. It could be interesting to see if people tend to use similar facial features. It can also be translated to an experimental procedure : let's say I read the description of a character using only personnality traits, and then ask participants to create such character, I think it could be a good way to observe stereotypes.

My questions are as follow : 

What do you think could be other interesting concepts that could be highlighted through character creation ? 

Are there exemple from the litterature using character creation as a task, and what did it measure ?

What would be your creative ideas for an experimental design with this technology ?

(headline of section:)  Unintended Consequences: Criminal justice reform in California removed
incentives to enter drug treatment.

&gt;...a measure called Proposition 47 is resulting in more low-level drug offenders on the street, and fewer in treatment. Approved by California voters in November 2014, Proposition 47 downgraded a wide range of theft and drug offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. Many suspects accused of these crimes now receive only a citation and little chance of jail time.

&gt;One consequence of Proposition 47 is that without the threat of incarceration, the justice system lost much of the leverage it once had to get people into drug treatment programs.

&gt;“Low-level drug offenses became misdemeanors. In California, that’s a citation, no matter how many times you’re caught, so there’s no incentive to stop reoffending,” said Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell, whose agency operates the largest jail in the nation and is the second largest police agency in the United States. “Before, people facing jail time would eventually accept treatment, but now that leverage is gone. And the number of people in treatment went down after that.”

To my understanding, and perhaps this can be clarified, non-law-enforcement-directed drug treatment programs are *voluntary* (outreach?), with people with drug issues asked or persuaded to enter treatment.  How do the two approaches compare in their successes, or lack thereof?

To the West, Freedom essentially means **freedom of press, of speech, of movement and freedom of religion.** In the west all these things were greater than in the east.

To socialism, instead, **freedom means to being free from the “economic chains” of a system.** For example: if you don’t have a guaranteed job, you know you can be fired and as such suffering hunger is a real possibility. You tremble thinking what to do if you get fired and therefore being without money, necessary to feed and provide health to your family. Therefore, job insecurity is an “economic chain” of capitalism, which socialism got rid off. **In this system, you just lived, while under capitalism you have to worry about being able to survive.** Therefore, this type of liberty/freedom was much more prevalent in the east.

,AskSocialScience,"It is claimed by a large amount of activists and organizations like EqualityNow that completely legalized or decriminalized prostitution leads to more abuse of prostitutes and human trafficking. There are a variety of arguments they put forth to advance this idea.

Most frequent is [the claim that countries with completely legalized prostitution experience more human trafficking](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/45198/1/Neumayer_Legalized_Prostitution_Increase_2012.pdf), and that pro-sex worker organizations are staffed by [abusers themselves.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/22/pimp-amnesty-prostitution-policy-sex-trade-decriminalise-brothel-keepers)

In contrast, Sweden has seen the number of trafficking victims,

&gt; [reduced by two thirds, and the number of johns has been reduced by 80%.” Trafficking is reportedly down to 200 to 400 girls and women a year, compared with 15,000 to 17,000 in nearby Finland.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/03/why-is-prostitution-illegal.html)

They also attack what they see as common assumptions of pre-legalization activists. Counter to what many say, one proposed benefit of the Nordicc model is that legalized prostitution makes it difficult to secure convictions in cases of sexual assault.

&gt;In legalised and decriminalised systems it is often extremely difficult for prostituted women to secure convictions against buyers for sexual assault, or even to have police and prosecutors take such cases seriously. Whereas, under the Nordic Model, a buyer can be charged automatically, simply as a result of having paid for sex.

In addition, decriminalization in nations like New Zealand and Germany does not seem to have increased the likelihood that prostitutes will report abuse.

&gt;full decriminalisation has not been found to offer any great police protection. The New Zealand government’s five-year review of the Prostitution Reform Act showed that a majority of respondents felt that decriminalisation made no difference with respect to the violence of johns \[buyers\] in prostitution, that “few” prostituted persons “reported any of the incidents of violence or crimes against them to the Police.”

To the idea that models such as these merely drives it underground, this is challenged by the fact that less people have reported buying sex in Sweden, and police have intercepted transmissions calling the country a ""bad market,"" and the malleability of the term ""underground.""

Other sources purporting to refute these supposed benefits come from reports from German prosecutors, where over one third stated that legalization “made their work in prosecuting trafficking in human beings and pimping more difficult,” with other studies stating that there were “no viable indications that the \[law\] has reduced crime,” and that ""Hardly any women in prostitution registered as an employee with a social insurance agency, and thus were **not afforded greater social protection** and benefits like health insurance and pension insurance."" These reports seem to have influenced the European Parliament, who largely accepts them.

And lastly, it's suggested that legalization can actually drive women into illegal forms of prostitution.

&gt;One goal of legalized prostitution was to move prostituted women indoors into brothels and clubs where they would be allegedly less vulnerable than in street prostitution. However, many women are in street prostitution because they want to avoid being controlled and exploited by pimps (transformed in legalized systems into sex businessmen). Other women do not want to register or submit to health checks, as required by law in some countries where prostitution is legalized (Schelzig, 2002). Thus, legalization may actually drive some women into street prostitution. Arguing against an Italian proposal for legalized prostitution, Esohe Aghatise has suggested that brothels actually deprive women of what little protection they may have on the street, confining women to closed spaces where they have little chance of meeting outreach workers or others who might help them exit prostitution (Aghatise, in press).

This is a lot to take in, and I'm sure the evidence on this front was complicated, but I was always led to believe that the majority opinion about this topic was that legalization was the best option. Are these reports about the efficacy of the Nordic model and the inefficiency of legalization accurate? Or is there something missing here?

&gt;A 2008 paper published by Global Financial Integrity estimated capital flight, also called illicit financial flows to be ""out of developing countries are some $850 billion to $1 trillion a year.""

&gt;A 2009 article in The Times reported that hundreds of wealthy financiers and entrepreneurs had recently fled the United Kingdom in response to recent tax increases, and had relocated in low tax destinations such as Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and the British Virgin Islands.

&gt;In the book La Dette Odieuse de l'Afrique: Comment l'endettement et la fuite des capitaux ont saigné un continent (Amalion 2013), Léonce Ndikumana and James K.

,AskSocialScience,"I'm looking for concepts or theoretical frameworks similar to what Jacques Derrida called ""autoimmunity."" Naturally, this is a metaphor that draws on the concept of the immune system of an organism attacking the organism itself. In Derrida's metaphorical usage, what this refers to is any time when liberalism leaves things so open and free that the system is no longer to protect itself from any threats to freedom.

Similarly, this could also describe the way that openness of a discussion forum could be so open that it effectively leads some people to feel like they can't actually be honest. Jo Freeman has used the term ""tyranny of structurelessness"" to talk about the ways that shunning hierarchical structure in small organizations means that not only do hierarchies emerge, but that no one can call them out because to call them out would be itself a speech act that places the speaker in a position of authority.

Given Derrida's rather opaque writing style, I'm paraphrasing what he means by autoimmunity since explicit definitions of his terms seem to be pretty rare in his writings.

Derrida develops the concept of autoimmunity here:

https://imgur.com/a/jWsmulO

In short: Patients arrive at the hospital and have their ""health measurements"" taken. It is also recorded whether they were immediately discharged from the hospital, or if they were required to stay. Given a new patient that enters the hospital and their health measurements are taken, I need to predict the response_variable for this patient - will they be immediately discharged from the hospital, or will they have to stay?

I have data from the last 50 years. It is obvious, that society, people's health and medicine have changed over the last 50 years (e.g. life expectancy has increased in many parts of the world). Perhaps in 1971, an elderly man who smoked his entire life would have had to stay for a prolonged period in the hospital - but in 2019, he might have been given a new drug that was developed in the last 5 years and then immediately discharged. The big question is : do these macro and micro time dependent trends within the variables need to be taken into account when creating statistical models?

So far, I created a decision tree (C5 algorithm) which completely ignores the ""time"" variable. That is, it is assumed that an elderly man from 1971 who smokes is identical to an elderly man that smokes in 2019. By completely ignoring the ""time"" variable, I was able to create a standard decision tree model that produces good results. I tested this two different ways:

1st way: I trained the decision tree using a random 70% sample of the data, and recorded its performance on the remaining 30% of the data.

2nd way: I kept data from 2019 separate. I then trained a decision tree using using data from previous years. Then I recorded the performance of the decision tree on 2019's data.

In both tests, the performance of the decision tree was good enough for my requirements.

But is just makes me curious: (looking at the imgur picture) what kind of data do I have? In statistics, is this considered Panel Data? Cross Section Data? Longitudinal Data? Time Series Data?

I have a feeling that is not longitudinal data - as far as I understand, longitudinal data repeatedly records measurements on the same patient (e.g. once every year). As far as I am concerned, all patients in my data are unique. Perhaps I am dealing with multivariate time series data?

Can someone please help me identify what kind of data this is? And what models are usually used for classifying this kind of data ?

,AskSocialScience,"Hi everyone, happy Monday! This is a kinda weird question in that, I know what I'm looking for but simply having trouble finding it through my typical avenues. I'm hoping someone here may know what I'm referencing or have superior search engine skills to my own.

Here's the details: I read a study a while back that may have been based on an NCVS or similar survey (their n sizes were fairly large so I assume it was a national survey of some scale) in the United States regarding the outcomes of burglaries. One key area of focus was the type of response the victim had, if they were home. There included yelling at the person, wielding a weapon of some kind (non-firearm like a bat or golf club), and wielding/brandishing a firearm. 

There were some further delineations of the type of yelling/weapon/firearm and the actions that both the perpetrator of the crime and the victim took. This was all in a big table, and one of the most interesting notes was that it seemed, based on the data/what I can remember, that just yelling at a burglar would have a better outcome in terms of the victim's personal safety than using or brandishing a firearm. 

Hope someone can help me find this! I'd really love to dive into the study deeper since I've gotten a lot better versed in amateur research (in no small part thanks to this sub) compared to where I was a few years ago when I initially found the study.

One key area of focus was the type of response the victim had, if they were home. There included yelling at the person, wielding a weapon of some kind (non-firearm like a bat or golf club), and wielding/brandishing a firearm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some further delineations of the type of yelling/weapon/firearm and the actions that both the perpetrator of the crime and the victim took. This was all in a big table, and one of the most interesting notes was that it seemed, based on the data/what I can remember, that just yelling at a burglar would have a better outcome in terms of the victim&amp;#39;s personal safety than using or brandishing a firearm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope someone can help me find this! I&amp;#39;d really love to dive into the study deeper since I&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot better versed in amateur research (in no small part thanks to this sub) compared to where I was a few years ago when I initially found the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and I hope you all have a great day &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

,AskSocialScience,"The success of the Portugal model with heroin addiction is clear: Treating addiction as a medical issue, providing heroin or methadone to addicts.   What seems less clear is how the Portugal model deals with recreational use of heroin and other other hard drugs. (Let's consider marijuana a non-issue). 

This 2017 article on Portugal's drug policy, [Portugal’s radical drugs policy is working. Why hasn’t the world copied it?](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it), offers some unusual perspectives:

&gt;Portugal’s policy rests on (several) pillars: one, that there’s no such thing as a soft or hard drug, only healthy and unhealthy relationships with drugs; two, that an individual’s unhealthy relationship with drugs often conceals frayed relationships with...the world around them...

&gt;I was told this again and again: thinking of drug addiction simply in terms of health and disease was too reductive. Some people are able to use drugs for years without any major disruption to their personal or professional relationships. It only became a problem, they told me, when it became a problem...  (Hereafter: **Point A**)

&gt;Local activists have pressed João Goulão, Portugal’s drug czar, to legalize...cannabis...sale in Portugal; for years, he has responded that the time wasn’t right. Legalising a single substance would call into question the foundation of Portugal’s drug and harm-reduction philosophy. If the drugs aren’t the problem, if the problem is the relationship with drugs, if there’s no such thing as a hard or a soft drug, and if all illicit substances are to be treated equally, he argued, then shouldn’t all drugs be legalised and regulated?

How do these perspectives translate into a drug policy? What messages should drug educators ideally, i.e., for most effectiveness in controlling the harms of drugs, impart to prospective drug users and addicts? 

This [2016 article on Portugal and drugs](https://www.vice.com/en/article/59eqqk/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin) offers more detail on procedure:

&gt;Portuguese authorities don't arrest...(people with)...less than a 10-day supply of an illicit drug...Instead, drug offenders...are ordered to appear before so- called ""dissuasion panels"" made up of legal, social, and psychological experts...Most cases are simply suspended...  *(Presumably, marijuana)*

&gt;For those who have been repeatedly caught or are identified as addicts, the panels can order sanctions or treatment. Recreational users may face fines or be ordered to provide community service...

This overview still leaves uncertainty as to the messaging about drugs.  **Questions on Point A:**  Last two sentences: entirely true. This could be termed recreational drug use. But is this what drug educators ought to be informing people?  Doesn't everyone who starts using drugs--or ponders doing so--think they will be in the group that can use them without problem?  (Maybe only 20-25% of all hard drug users rank here??)

Also, most writings on the Portugal model discuss only heroin and marijuana; much less is written on meth, cocaine, crack, ecstasy, designer drugs, PCP -- drugs that are fairly common in America.  The second link writes:

&gt;Though heroin use is often highlighted to show the efficacy of Portugal's model, today most users that come before panels are in fact caught with either hashish or cannabis.

,AskSocialScience,"My main motivation for posting here is a simple but vague question: what percentage of Americans are racist?

I did try looking for some polls/studies on this, but I came up surprisingly short. A lot of polls are polls of how Americans view the status of racial equality in the country rather than an assessment of what I would consider ""racial views"" - in other words, whether somebody believes races are/aren't social constructs, whether they have positive or negative opinions of certain races and ethnicities, etc. I've found one poll that I think most people have probably already seen, the one that suggests 9% of Americans sympathize with neo-Nazis. But that was a couple years ago, and I don't know how that result differs from, say, 20 years prior to the poll. Also, it specifically asks questions about white supremacist views, which, while definitely the most concerning racist ideology in America in my opinion, is also not necessarily representative of all racist views, which include black supremacy, antisemitism, Islamophobia, etc.

Now, I do recognize that racism is a bit of a spectrum, and the size of that spectrum is debatable. The line between outright racist views and racially insensitive/ignorant views is blurry. In other words, I'm not expecting to get a definitive percentage of Americans who are ""racist."" But I do feel it's feasible to get a grasp on, for example, what percentage of Americans believe black people are inferior or superior to white people, and potentially to what degree they think they are inferior/superior. So, rather than asking ""What percentage of Americans are racist?"", it might be more worth asking for polls or research into the specific racial/ethnic views of Americans.

,AskSocialScience,"What do people with a low IQ (80 and less) do (career-wise)? Can an unintelligent person be a capable manager? Do they live mostly on social welfare? 

Does being unintelligent relate to poverty, or does poverty lead to a person being less intelligent? Will an unintelligent person born in a ""normal family"" end up poor (unless taken care of by the family)?

My initial statement mentions the idea of someone having a low IQ. I understand that people with certain disabilities would score lower on an IQ test, while still being intelligent. I am not talking about the cases where an IQ test is unreliable.

I've heard that unintelligent are losing their place in society (lecture by J. Peterson). Unintelligent people have more trouble finding jobs (everyone faces difficulties while searching for a job), especially with less demand in physical labor as they are being replaced by machines. That leads to poverty. And poverty leads to more uneducation, drugs, pregnancies, criminal behaviour. Or is it being born in poverty that causes this cycle to begin with?

[According to this website](https://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQtable.aspx), ~10% of people have an IQ lower than 80 (with a 15 SD, so I assume the number is not completely reliable). That would mean 800 million people are... pretty unintelligent? Isn't that a problem we should be worried about? Even in a western country like Spain, that is 500 thousand people out of 50 million. (even more, since the average IQ is 98 as opposed to 100)

*My reason for asking these questions:* I am a student. My parents are also graduates. According to some sources, I can safely assume our IQ is above 105. With that in mind, I assume that my social circles (within uni) and the family friends I grew up with have been rather intelligent people. I didn't have friends in school, so I didn't get to know people in that setting. I have no idea how unintelligent the other side of the world is. Is an IQ of 80 really stupid? Are they pretty much normal people that I wouldn't be able to differentiate in a random setting?

If I've made any wrong assumptions in my post, I am open to being corrected on the assumption rather than the idea that evolved from it. I am open to reading studies done on this topic. I don't study psychology/sociology, so I had trouble finding relevant articles on this topic.

Can an unintelligent person be a capable manager? Do they live mostly on social welfare? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does being unintelligent relate to poverty, or does poverty lead to a person being less intelligent? Will an unintelligent person born in a &amp;quot;normal family&amp;quot; end up poor (unless taken care of by the family)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial statement mentions the idea of someone having a low IQ. I understand that people with certain disabilities would score lower on an IQ test, while still being intelligent. I am not talking about the cases where an IQ test is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard that unintelligent are losing their place in society (lecture by J. Peterson). Unintelligent people have more trouble finding jobs (everyone faces difficulties while searching for a job), especially with less demand in physical labor as they are being replaced by machines. That leads to poverty. And poverty leads to more uneducation, drugs, pregnancies, criminal behaviour. Or is it being born in poverty that causes this cycle to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQtable.aspx""&gt;According to this website&lt;/a&gt;, ~10% of people have an IQ lower than 80 (with a 15 SD, so I assume the number is not completely reliable).

I think it may possible that people educated in a non-christian culture could increase their well-being after taking revenge and not having long-term harmful consequences. But I am not sure and people from non-christian countries could feel in the same way as occidentals after taking revenge.

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, are any social science fields known for the robustness of their statistical/quantitative methodologies, or perhaps lack thereof?&lt;/p&gt;

I think the question is pretty self-explanatory, but here are my two cents.

I think natural resources belong to anybody who lives in that country.

A few days ago, I read this wonderful [article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/07/therapy-wars-revenge-of-freud-cognitive-behavioural-therapy) by Oliver Burkeman that seems to suggest that psychoanalytic therapies are well-positioned to address issues such as the root causes of mental suffering in ways that CBT is not and I have a few questions:

1) I was under the (possibly incorrect) impression that much of Freud's theories are largely considered to be pseudoscience and therapies based on them do not qualify as 'evidence-based' treatments. To what extent is this true?

2) Is psychoanalysis better positioned to treat the 'root cause' of mental illness than CBT or am I misreading this?
&gt;CBT embodies a very specific view of painful emotions: that they’re primarily something to be eliminated, or failing that, made tolerable. A condition such as depression, then, is a bit like a cancerous tumour: sure, it might be useful to figure out where it came from – but it’s far more important to get rid of it. CBT doesn’t exactly claim that happiness is easy, but it does imply that it’s relatively simple: your distress is caused by your irrational beliefs, and it’s within your power to seize hold of those beliefs and change them.

&gt; Psychoanalysts contend that things are much more complicated. For one thing, psychological pain needs first not to be eliminated, but understood. From this perspective, depression is less like a tumour and more like a stabbing pain in your abdomen: it’s telling you something, and you need to find out what. (No responsible GP would just pump you with painkillers and send you home.) And happiness – if such a thing is even achievable – is a much murkier matter. We don’t really know our own minds, and we often have powerful motives for keeping things that way. We see life through the lens of our earliest relationships, though we usually don’t realise it; we want contradictory things; and change is slow and hard. Our conscious minds are tiny iceberg-tips on the dark ocean of the unconscious – and you can’t truly explore that ocean by means of CBT’s simple, standardised, science-tested steps.

3) Is it accurate to say that CBT sees mental illnesses such as depression as symptoms of irrational thinking?
&gt; For traditional psychoanalysts – and those who practise newer “psychodynamic” techniques, largely derived from traditional psychoanalysis – what happens in therapy is that seemingly irrational symptoms, such as the endless repetition of self-defeating patterns in love or work, are revealed to be at least somewhat rational. They’re responses that made sense in the context of the patient’s earliest experience. (If a parent abandoned you, years ago, it’s not so strange to live in constant dread that your spouse might do so too – and thus to act in ways that screw up your marriage as a result.) CBT flips that on its head. Emotions that might appear rational – such as feeling depressed about what a catastrophe your life is – stand exposed as the result of irrational thinking. Sure, you lost your job; but it doesn’t follow that everything will be awful forever.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did this shift in how religions function occur? What were reasons behind this shift?&lt;/p&gt;

,AskSocialScience,"Hello,

I’m working on a paper about the main differences between the theism and animism in regards to lawmaking. 

The way I understand human history, “indigenous” philosophy was born with us right at the beginning of humanity, and it is an animist perspective of our place in the world and universe. That is, we are embedded in circular relations with all the spirits in the world, and we as humans have our place in maintaining harmony like the mountains and the birds and every other relation. This way of understanding life is the foundation we built as humans at our onset, which then spread around the world as we migrated out of Africa. This would be why aboriginal groups in Australia and indigenous groups in North America have similar perspectives regarding the manner in which resources are to be used for our survival — with gratitude and respect for the gifts other creatures give us. 

On the other hand, theism is markedly different. I think it emerged in Mesopotamia some 10,000 ago when an innovation in the way agriculture was practiced made it suddenly much more efficient, which allowed for growing group sizes, which then demanded innovations in social management. My belief is that in the process of division of labour between groups of strangers (because collectives had gotten so big that you couldn’t really be familiar with everyone in your community anymore), specializations occurred on family lines, and this caused a spiritual alienation between the “self” and the “others”. Over time the food producing families (since not every family needed to produce food anymore, a few were enough to provide for everyone) gained power, and the spiritual alienation resulted in theism, which is the belief that there is one almighty who imposes their vision on the whole world. This was the start of kings and empires, and as this form of agricultural society spread from the Fertile Crescent to the rest of the connected continents, the world as we know it today began. 

In theism, Law is imposed from the top down. There is an assumption that people in general cannot be trusted, and that good order is authoritarian. The king, or the clergy, or today the politicians are an exclusive class with more moral ability than the masses, and they have the god-given mandate to protect the masses from themselves by creating laws. Laws must be imposed by force when necessary — this is sovereignty. When groups under different kings/governments clash, they must attempt to conquer each other and subdue the other beneath the “right” laws. (Obviously this has a lot to do with resource hoarding and the economic benefit of the higher class, but the way I see it is that this is considered necessary to supply the empire with the resources to protect themselves from the next, inevitable threatening “other”). 

Here’s where my question starts:

How does animism differ in its conception of lawmaking? As far as I understand, Law exists in the universe, and every individual (human and not) has the ability to decipher it. Each is trusted to know what role they play in maintaining order, and when someone strays from the moral path, then they will suffer the consequences of causing imbalance. It is not necessary to forcibly impose law on each other. 

Am I completely off base? Have I oversimplified and missed some crucial similarities between animism and theism? Do you recommend any particular scholars who are exploring this issue as well for me to read up on?

Thank you for your time :)

In a nutshell, the Banality of Evil explores the subjective nature of evil as every human is capable of doing things that are considered as ""evil"" or ""wrong"" and can do or be forced to do them for all sorts of reasons.

One reason, in particular, is that because of authority as explored by the Milgram Shock Experiment, or when people are given authority and can give them the opportunity to abuse that power to others if the conditions are right like in the Standford Prison Experiment.

The Banality of Evil explores a lot on the story of Adolf Eichmann, a former member of the SS and one of the major organizers of the Holocaust. What made this story interesting was that when he was trailed for his actions, he claimed that he was simply following orders.

So in the case of Hitler's philosophy and the idea of the promise of the Third Reich and Aryan supremeacy, how was he able to convince entire groups of people to fight for his cause or support/sympathise his philosophy in some way?

I know that anti-Semitism has existed before WW2 and was also one of the scapegoats that were used to demonise the Jews for causing WW1 and other major historical events throughout history in the past.

And I also know that Hitler's personality and his development of the Nazi philosophy has been researched and speculated for many years.

&lt;p&gt;I know that anti-Semitism has existed before WW2 and was also one of the scapegoats that were used to demonise the Jews for causing WW1 and other major historical events throughout history in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also know that Hitler&amp;#39;s personality and his development of the Nazi philosophy has been researched and speculated for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how did this translate to large groups of people simply neglecting morality and replacing the justification with fanatic zeal and genocide and war and other war crimes or crimes against humanity, and extreme support to the Fuhrer and the Nazi philosophy as though it is the supreme rule of all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if my question is relevant, as I know very little about political science. So feel free to tell me if my question does not make sense at all!&lt;/p&gt;

* Research on perception of purpose-driven jobs in general. Do people feel that purpose-driven = charity/low-paying?

,AskSocialScience,"Did you know that behavior and mental illness can spread just like a viral contagion? Read wikipedia articles on Mass Psychogenic Illness, and the Dancing Plague of 1518. Also look up the social contagion in LeRoy NY in 2011.

Considering all this, we have to ask ourselves: how much is the Internet a fomite for the spread of psychogenic contagion? Are there inoculations we can utilize? How much of the toxic culture we're currently seeing (and have seen for a long time) be hypothesized to be of psychogenic contagion in origin?

If we compare mass psychogenic illness to a viral contagion, the virus must also have certain environmental requirements in order to infect the host. With Covid-19 as an example, it can only infect hosts with the ACE2 protein (found in humans and cats). In addition, viral spread needs certain conditions such as poor ventilation in enclosed spaces, lack of hygiene, refusal to wear a mask properly, etc. And with social contagion, certain environmental factors must exist--whether they be physical factors like lead in the drinking water (causing outbreaks of violence), or mental and spiritual factors like belief in witches, conspiracy theories, a general distrust of ""intellectuals,"" etc.

Considering all that, I think finding a social inoculation for a social contagion is really difficult (assuming this is a desirable thing to discover). First, you have to untangle the web of factors, and then find ways to counter them. Considering that social ""rights and wrongs"" are so subjective, I don't know if inoculation is even possible.

,AskSocialScience,"This would be meta/about this sub, but it's also about how the social sciences relate to social reality.

Observation: I've noticed that many posters on this sub struggle to formulate their question in such a way that it makes sense to a social scientist, and that it can be answered with clarity, precision, and defined limitations. Obviously, this means that these questions don't get the best possible answers.

One source of confusion is, understandably, concepts that we use in a specific way in the field, but that have a (related but) different meaning in everyday life. This happens a lot to most undergrad students, so it is not surprising that it should happen here.

Many times, this is fine, and after some back and forth with the poster, we get to the question they really want answered, or they learn something about the complexity of the topic, or the different meaning of their concept, etcetera. Personally, I find those moments very rewarding.

What often happens next makes me sad: the person asking the question removes their post. (This happens for comment threads, too.) Sad because for one, other people will have similar questions or confusions and now they can't lean on the curiosity of the previous poster. Also sad because there should be no shame at all in going through a learning process - in fact, I have nothing but respect for people who keep asking questions and listening until they understand. 

So. Social scientists: do you have any tips or comments on how posters should (not) phrase their questions here? What are common causes of miscommunication between social scientists and, essentially, their field of study? 

So. Those of you with questions (if I may ask, I'm sure mods will let me know if I can't): what do you need from us?

,AskSocialScience,"Hi, r/AskSocialScience. 

I am a commercial/corporate filmmaker and one of the products I sell are ""Intervention films"". These are films that are used to change the behavior of a target group and can be best used when the target group is already informed of the situation but doesn't quite comprehend the context of the situation.

For example, someone can know how dangerous it is to share their personal data online. But until our own data is stolen, we do not understand the context or the weight sharing our data personal online carries. 

This is the structure I have found these films to have:

1.	Introduction:
What is the action that is about to take place and why there is tension there?
2.	Action:
Execution of an intervention. By combining a ‘normal’ element and an ‘absurd’ element you can create the release of tension. For example, having a blind man drive a car.
3.	Revelation of the action:
The unknowing participants are revealed what is actually happening.
4.	Message:
A message explaining why the action took place and a link to some type of landing page where the viewers or target group can take further action on the matter.
5.	Landing page:
The landing page is either a flyer, poster, or website populated by images or videos or text about the campaign. It is a page where the target group can go to get more information on the campaign.

I have put together a list of examples down below and my question is: Can someone point me in the right direction as to what this socio/psychological mechanism is called and where I can learn more about it so I can make better ""Intervention Films""?

After trying to find an application for data science in an area of my interest, I discovered computational social sciences.

The computation social scientists can have a very distinct background, for example there are some from a social science background and others from natural sciences or computer science background. The ones with a background in social science claims that the others work have problem because the often don't use social science theory. In its turn, researchers from natural sciences / computer science affirms that the traditional social science theory is not sufficient to understand large amounts of data. What do you think about that question? Is there a ""winner"" in this discussion?

https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/

For example: One of the first things I noticed while browsing through various years' ""Crime in the United States"" publications is a sidenote stating that data on the number of persons convicted, prosecuted, and imprisoned are not collected by the UCR programme – only the number of people arrested. Therefore, the claim that FBI data shows that black people are disproportionately responsible for crimes can already be proven to be entirely unsubstantiated, without even needing to look at any numbers, as the number of people arrested for any given offense can't just be baselessly conflated with the number of people responsible for that offense. As per one of the supposed core maxims of the USA: ""innocent until proven guilty.

When it comes to national data on murders, the National Criminal Justice Reference Service reported many years ago: “The FBI Uniform Crime Report’s (UCR’s) ‘murder and non-negligent manslaughter’ data are so seriously flawed that the only figure they can provide criminologists is the number of deaths investigated by police as potentially criminal homicides, and the weapons use data reported by the UCR and the National Crime Survey (victimization data) are unreliable as well.” Another problem with the FBI data on crimes in general is: “If the same person commits multiple crimes simultaneously, then the most significant crime is the only one that receives a statistical notation in the UCR.”

A Capital News Services report in January found major differences in crime statistics reported by different agencies in Maryland. “In one county, for example, the FBI reported 13 people murdered; the state police listed 23 and the county, 26…The FBI also reported 23 fewer murders statewide in 2017 than the Maryland State Police did. In the 2016 reports, the FBI listed two more murders than the state police did.” This does not provide a great deal of confidence in the data from the FBI. According to Adam Wandt, a public policy professor at John Jay College: “Some states report better than others.” Despite these flaws, the data is all we have to work with nationally.

Using the 2018 data, 16,335 murder offenders are listed. Of those, 4,821 have their race listed as unknown (29.5%); 4,884 are listed as White (29.9%); 6,318 are listed as Black (38.7%); 1,576 are listed as Hispanic or Latino (9.6%); 312 are listed as other race (1.9%). However 8,375 of the 16,335 have their ethnicity listed as unknown. That is 51.2% of those listed. 14,396 of the 16,335 are either listed as Not Hispanic or are of unknown ethnicity (88.1%). Once again ethnicity data is very unreliable and skews the data. The police choose how to identify a person’s race and ethnicity. It is not that hard to ask a person to self identify. Of the 2018 victims 52.4% were black, 43.1% where white, and 2.8% are listed as other race while 15.4% are listed as Hispanic or Latino.

White people kill thousands of white people every year and no one ever talks about “white-on-white crime.” Googling “white-on-white crime” returns 2,200,000 results in .034 seconds; Googling black-on-black crime on the other hand returns 1,110,000,000 results in 0.45 seconds.That is 50 times more results for the term black-on-black crime. It has become a part of the English language in a way that white-on-white crime has not.

In 2018 using FBI data 10,310,960 persons were arrested. 1,654,282 were arrested for drug abuse violations; 1,001,329 for driving under the influence; 887,622 for larceny-theft; 395,800 for aggravated assault; 329,152 for disorderly conduct; 328,772 for drunkenness; and 11,970 for murder and non-negligent manslaughter.

When people use the term black-on-black crime they will typically follow that up with the number of murders over a period of time. The term is a euphemism for black murder of other blacks. Since murderers are only 0.12 percent of all arrestees in 2018, apparently those who use this term as a weapon are unconcerned about other crimes and victims.

Using the “black-on-black” crime argument you would think black people are the only ones killing each other. The circumstances related to the murders that are occurring are rarely taken into consideration. Of the murders and non-negligent manslaughters where circumstances are known, 24% of people were killed as the result of an argument; only 3.9% are during the course of a robbery; and just 4.3 % are gang related.

According to 2018 data, when race of offenders and victims are known, (which is in just 45.7 percent of murders), 81 percent of whites are listed as killed by other whites, 15.5 percent of whites are listed as killed by blacks, 88.9 percent of blacks are listed as killed by other blacks and 8 percent of blacks are listed as killed by whites.

Now, if under half the race of victims and offebders are known, and cops can alter data, is tgis really trustworthy?

Of the 2018 victims 52.4% were black, 43.1% where white, and 2.8% are listed as other race while 15.4% are listed as Hispanic or Latino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White people kill thousands of white people every year and no one ever talks about “white-on-white crime.” Googling “white-on-white crime” returns 2,200,000 results in .034 seconds; Googling black-on-black crime on the other hand returns 1,110,000,000 results in 0.45 seconds.That is 50 times more results for the term black-on-black crime. It has become a part of the English language in a way that white-on-white crime has not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 using FBI data 10,310,960 persons were arrested. 1,654,282 were arrested for drug abuse violations; 1,001,329 for driving under the influence; 887,622 for larceny-theft; 395,800 for aggravated assault; 329,152 for disorderly conduct; 328,772 for drunkenness; and 11,970 for murder and non-negligent manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people use the term black-on-black crime they will typically follow that up with the number of murders over a period of time. The term is a euphemism for black murder of other blacks. Since murderers are only 0.12 percent of all arrestees in 2018, apparently those who use this term as a weapon are unconcerned about other crimes and victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the “black-on-black” crime argument you would think black people are the only ones killing each other. The circumstances related to the murders that are occurring are rarely taken into consideration. Of the murders and non-negligent manslaughters where circumstances are known, 24% of people were killed as the result of an argument; only 3.9% are during the course of a robbery; and just 4.3 % are gang related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to 2018 data, when race of offenders and victims are known, (which is in just 45.7 percent of murders), 81 percent of whites are listed as killed by other whites, 15.5 percent of whites are listed as killed by blacks, 88.9 percent of blacks are listed as killed by other blacks and 8 percent of blacks are listed as killed by whites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if under half the race of victims and offebders are known, and cops can alter data, is tgis really trustworthy?
&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/f96u0e/racist_thinks_the_nypd_is_right_to_have_a_dna/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfOutrageCulture/comments/f96u0e/racist_thinks_the_nypd_is_right_to_have_a_dna/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see none of these whites getting arrested: &lt;a href=""https://www.bet.com/news/national/2020/05/31/white-extremists-terrorize-and-loot-10-videos-of-destruction-bl.html""&gt;https://www.bet.com/news/national/2020/05/31/white-extremists-terrorize-and-loot-10-videos-of-destruction-bl.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All you really have to do is compare overall murder rates, solved and unsolved, in overwhelmingly black jurisdictions to those in mostly white ones. The disparity is even larger than what you would expect if black murder rates were “only” eight times larger than non-whites.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This depends if the rates are accurate to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

Jordan Peterson made this post some time ago. I fell into him a while ago before I became very quickly disillusioned with much of what he says.

However, he does raise some points here.
Basically, JP is trying to raise the point that
A) hiring based on diversity suggests that those differences between people are important that they have meaningful impacts, which essentially gives ammo to the racists?

B) intersectionality is infinite, so any attempt to meet it would not be enough. 

He says ""In consequence, I would like to suggest that the proper way to determine who gets what slice of which pie in a given organization is the manner in which employers are legally bound to hire: first, they must conduct an analysis of the job to determine and list its requirements; then, with certain exceptions they are required to hire, place or promote the person who is most qualified to undertake that job, regardless of attributes that are not relevant to the task. These include, in my opinion, the differences in race, sex, gender, and their combinations (as well as the other intrinsic differences we discussed) that are pushed so assiduously, self-righteously and thoughtlessly by the progressives who think they can replace comparatively well-functioning meritocracies, aimed at the solution of serious problems by the most qualified people with candidates chosen on the basis of attributes that would clearly be viewed as prejudicial if they were used as grounds for rejection, failure to promote, and firing.""

I feel that this misses the point that its not solely about the task. A employment position or going to a school has profound impacts on everyone, from the people around you at school or the workplace to your family and community. I guess my point is something about the diversity of experiences, in that those differences in experiences often relate to gender, sex, race, age, and SES status, so that may be relevant. 

I feel like I am not smart enough to mount a strong critique, so please help me. How do you counter this narrative? 

Can anyone comment on this?

Also, I'll post some studies about diversity that I've found and would like some feedback on, essentially the question of:

,AskSocialScience,"Let's take Japanese as an example: their choices of words that pragmatically mean the same thing is contingent on social hierarchy — with different politeness levels to boot (*kudaketa*, *teinei*, and *keigo*). The words you vary greatly depending on whether you're talking to some on an equal social standing like a classmate, close friend, co-worker or someone on a higher status like parent or your manager. Honorifics too mean way more to them in everyday use than to English speakers, who can usually refer to their high school seniors with no need for honorifics without any fear of being called 'disrespectful'. 

The same holds true for Indonesian culture as well; 1st grade high schoolers must refer to their upperclassmen as 'Kak \[name\]' lest they be branded as 'disrespectful'.  Similar to the Japanese, Bahasa Indonesia is also categorized in forms of 'formal' and 'informal' language. 

I don't really see this linguistic distinction being that apparent in English speaking culture. While politeness to superiors is a universal thing in general, in English there doesn't seem to be a clear cut distinction between 'formal language' and 'informal language'.

,AskSocialScience,"Hi:

Some research have found jealousy in heterosexual couples cause that an opposite sex-friendship of one member of the couple is frequently seen as a threat by the other member. 2 examples:

Worley, T &amp; Samp, J. 2014. Friendship Characteristics, Threat Appraisals, and Varieties of Jealousy about Romantic Partners’ Friendships. Interpersona: An International Journal on Personal Relationships, 8(2), 231-244

Gilchrist-Petty, E &amp; Bennet, L. K. 2019. Cross-Sex Best Friendships and the Experience and Expression of Jealousy within Romantic Relationships. Journal of Relationships Research Research 10, e18, 1–9.

As a consequence, I suspect there could be:

1. A non-written code between heterosexual males that says men should keep distance with other men’s girlfriends/wifes, specially between friends. For “keep distance” I mean try to not be too “nice”, outgoing, etc.
2. A non-written code between heterosexual females that says women should, in the same way, keep distance with other women’s boyfriends/husbands, specially between friends.

If that codes (ot al least one on them) exists, exceptions could be common, so that codes could be not necesarily strict. For example:

Code 1 (between males) exception example: when the woman (remember, another men’s partner, probably a friend’s) is not only an acquaintance but also a member of the group of friends. Then, confidence exist, so men can be more natural with her. However, men’s unwritten code (if exists) “bans” being too “nice”/outgoing with another men’s female partner if she is not a friend but only an acquaintance or frienship with her is very low. The code should be abided specially if the male partner of that woman is present.

Code 2 (between females) exception example: the same situation but exchanging sexes.

Could you send me research papers that clarify if that codes exist or no? I’ll be very grateful.

&lt;li&gt;A non-written code between heterosexual females that says women should, in the same way, keep distance with other women’s boyfriends/husbands, specially between friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that codes (ot al least one on them) exists, exceptions could be common, so that codes could be not necesarily strict. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code 1 (between males) exception example: when the woman (remember, another men’s partner, probably a friend’s) is not only an acquaintance but also a member of the group of friends. Then, confidence exist, so men can be more natural with her. However, men’s unwritten code (if exists) “bans” being too “nice”/outgoing with another men’s female partner if she is not a friend but only an acquaintance or frienship with her is very low. The code should be abided specially if the male partner of that woman is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code 2 (between females) exception example: the same situation but exchanging sexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you send me research papers that clarify if that codes exist or no? I’ll be very grateful. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Fortunately, these huge increases in total number of people shot may not translate into equally immense increases in murders, because 2020’s shooters don’t seem as efficient at killing people. Fewer people appear to be dying per person shot this year. For example, murders are up only 35 percent in New York City due to a decline in marksmanship among Gotham’s would-be assassins.

&gt;This suggests that a large fraction of the Summer of George’s incremental shootings are by blacks, who historically have had the lowest ratio of kills to wounded. (Contrary to what you might assume from watching rap videos, holding your gun sideways doesn’t actually help you shoot straight.)

&gt;Although the national press has promoted the idea that almost all mass shootings are carried out by white male terrorists with rifles in schools or churches, those are rare, although horrifically lethal when they do happen.

My question now is this: How much people lie about their vote?

Sometimes I suspect people usually lie about their political ideas and, as a consequence, they lie about their real vote.

For example, if a man has right-wing ideas but in his social life usually deal with people from left-wing, he may lie about his own political ideas and/or his own vote (Of course, a woman could do the same, but I put a man in the example for avoiding write “he/she” and “his/her” everytime).

I suspect people lie A LOT about that kind of things, because social pressure may be strong, and people usually want to have social life, and someone who defy the ideology of the group takes the risk of being excluded.

,AskSocialScience,"I've been thinking a lot about this, and I just don't know what the consensus is. 

The issue is that I see a lot of great leaders who had great career paths and despite challenges in life were able to overcome them. An obvious example of this is Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seems to have been a naturally talented person - she graduated high school at the age of 15, and was able to go to the best schools, that is, any challenges she faced were external.

After some thorough research on Wikipedia and Crash Course Sociology, I've come across concepts like formal organizations (i guess this is a concept from Weber's work, but I'm not sure?), institutional economics, theory of the firm, complex systems, etc. Unfortunately, the Wikipedia's rabbit hole haven't really helped settling my mind's inquiry.

To be more specific, some of my questions about these entities are:

* How do they come to be? At some point they're just a bunch of people wanting to accomplish something and then, somehow, they become this thing that has its own set of values, independent of the people that work in it.
* How they maintain or change these values through time?
* Is there some pattern in their structure?
* What role does Law have in then? It seems to have great importance.

,AskSocialScience,"I was recently doing some personal research on homosexual heritability studies and came across a review of a book by Neil Whitehead, a supposed doctor with questionable credentials, which purported that genetic and prenatal factors had minimal influence on wether someone was gay or not.

At the beginning they make a point of saying that,

&gt; ""One study cited showed that 84 percent of homosexual men said that their fathers were indifferent to them. This was compared to only 10 percent of the heterosexual men studied. Lesbians have poorer relationships with their mothers than heterosexual woman. There is also a correlation in both with early sexual abuse.

This seems to be a prevalent talking point among conversion therapy supporters, and I was wondering how that statistic is reached.

They also talk about twin studies,

&gt;What about identical twin studies? Do they offer proof that homosexuality is genetic? Studies have shown that when one identical twin is homosexual then the other twin has a 50% change of being homosexual. But to offer proof the chance should be 100%, since all the DNA which the twins inherit is identical. The rules for scientifically valid twin study analysis have seven requirements which in practical terms are impossible to meet.   
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, twins are not identical to the general population as they have a much higher rate of child abuse than non-twins as well as other differences which could make a difference in statistical results. The rate of homosexuality itself is higher in twins. In any event, the Whiteheads believe that a ""50% heritability"" doesn't mean much since other twin studies have shown that religiosity is also at the 50% level, as is altruism and fundamentalism. Even divorce is at a 52% level. These characteristics, we know, are not genetically determined. The concordance for lesbianism is much less. So homosexuality is not destined for the other twin even if one is homosexual.

They also discussed research from [Clellan S. Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clellan_S._Ford) and [Frank A. Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Beach) that stated that ""In twenty-nine of seventy-nine culture surveys... homosexuality was rare or absent."" Part of me believes this may be in part due to different attitudes about sexuality making gay or lesbian people less visible, but that's just speculation.

Maybe Cajuns? German-Americans pre-WW1? Italians? Edit: how could I forget, the Amish! And Mennonites, And Hasidim, and maybe other ultra-religious groups etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

,AskSocialScience,"So yesterday I was sitting with two of my roommates, Tim and Tammy, in our kitchen and for whatever reason I can't remember cultural appropriation was brought up. 

My stance on this subject was always that I genuinely never understood it and deemed it as a stupid concept, but I am not too educated on the subject whereas my roommates both are, atleast a lot more than me. 
Naturally we engaged in a discussion, because they wanted to explain and change my view. 

The main example we were talking about was braids. Tammy told me that braids are a thing that was brought into life by black people and that slaves used to hide food in their braids or other items. 
Because of this reason it is beyond unacceptable if white people were to get braids, as they never experienced such things and most don't even know about the meaning behind them. Both of them said that it's simply nothing that you get for the aesthetic only and that doing so would be ignorant. 


I don't understand this point for this reason: Braids have this origin, yes, but for example afro-american youth has never experienced slavery. In my opinion they don't have more of a connection to braids than caucasians that live today. Perhaps this is a wrong viewpoint, but that's why I am here looking to find answers. 

I told them this exact thing and they both responded that even though black youth has never experienced slavery, they still suffer from it's effects on the society, a point I wholeheartedly agree with. But what does that have to do with the topic? 

If braids were used the way Tammy described and people don't do it now, atleast young black people in the western world (by that I mean maybe people in other parts of the world still have them for this very reason ), what's the difference? Or to put it like this: If braids was a hairstyle of slaves and thus part of slave-culture (in the sense that slaves have had their very own culture, like the music genre Blues could be identified as part of slaves culture) then according to the logic of cultural appropriation shouldn't only slaves be allowed to wear braids, because everything else is disrespectful? 

I hope you guys understand what I mean, this is such a complicated issue and it's hard to explain my thoughts perfectly in a foreign language. 

Anyways, our discussion led to nowhere, however I told them I'd try to further learn about this issue and thus spend a couple of hours on this topic today. This sadly didn't really help, as most arguments genuinely didn't make sense to me. 

The strongest argument I encountered was that cultural appropriation is so bad because it kind of devalues the symbolism behind the appropriated thing and thus is damaging to the culture. 

However after thinking about it, I found myself completely disagreeing with it for two reasons:

1) If for example you see a caucasian dude with rastas, you see just that. You have no idea whether or not this person actually is a practicing rastafarian. Not a single person in the world knows unless you directly approach this person. So how does it devalue the symbolism when you have no chance of knowing for what reason a person wears rastas? 

2) In the circumstance that you approach the dude and ask him about the rastas and he really only has them for aesthetic reasons, how does it change the meaning of rastas? I mean if you're a practicing rastafarian and meet someone with rastas who isn't a practicing rastafarian, why does that devalue the symbol in your eyes? I genuinely don't understand. The symbol still has the same meaning in your religion and will always have that meaning, nobody can change that. 

I mean look at the cross for example. It's used on so many things these days, people get it tattooed for aesthetic reasons, yet it hasn't lost it's meaning for the christians. 

Again, I have very little knowledge on this topic and maybe tackle the issue from an completely wrong viewpoint, but I always followed the principle to generally rate someone's actions and behavior based on their intentions. 

If you get dreadlocks because you appreciate them and like how they look, in my eyes you're golden. 
Once you however do things to explicitly disrespect or mock something of a different culture, you're a cunt. 

I feel like people choose to be offended, whereas another perspective could be to understand that imitation is the highest from of flattery. Isn't it a good thing if someone sees something from a different culture and likes so much that he adopts it? 





This is a long post in terrible English with a hot topic, but I am genuinely interested in learning and understanding through civil discussions. Because at the end the f the day I really don't want to be a cunt that hurts other people if there's an actual valid reason for that they are hurt.",t2_faaiewh,False,,0,False,I had a heated discussion about cultural appropriation with my roommates yesterday and I want to educate myself further on this topic/have civil discussions on it,[],r/AskSocialScience,False,6,,0,,False,t3_isaaey,False,dark,0.87,,public,26,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,26,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1600072191.0,text,6,,,text,self.AskSocialScience,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I was sitting with two of my roommates, Tim and Tammy, in our kitchen and for whatever reason I can&amp;#39;t remember cultural appropriation was brought up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stance on this subject was always that I genuinely never understood it and deemed it as a stupid concept, but I am not too educated on the subject whereas my roommates both are, atleast a lot more than me. 
Naturally we engaged in a discussion, because they wanted to explain and change my view. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main example we were talking about was braids. Tammy told me that braids are a thing that was brought into life by black people and that slaves used to hide food in their braids or other items. 
Because of this reason it is beyond unacceptable if white people were to get braids, as they never experienced such things and most don&amp;#39;t even know about the meaning behind them. Both of them said that it&amp;#39;s simply nothing that you get for the aesthetic only and that doing so would be ignorant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand this point for this reason: Braids have this origin, yes, but for example afro-american youth has never experienced slavery. In my opinion they don&amp;#39;t have more of a connection to braids than caucasians that live today. Perhaps this is a wrong viewpoint, but that&amp;#39;s why I am here looking to find answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told them this exact thing and they both responded that even though black youth has never experienced slavery, they still suffer from it&amp;#39;s effects on the society, a point I wholeheartedly agree with. But what does that have to do with the topic? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If braids were used the way Tammy described and people don&amp;#39;t do it now, atleast young black people in the western world (by that I mean maybe people in other parts of the world still have them for this very reason ), what&amp;#39;s the difference? Or to put it like this: If braids was a hairstyle of slaves and thus part of slave-culture (in the sense that slaves have had their very own culture, like the music genre Blues could be identified as part of slaves culture) then according to the logic of cultural appropriation shouldn&amp;#39;t only slaves be allowed to wear braids, because everything else is disrespectful? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you guys understand what I mean, this is such a complicated issue and it&amp;#39;s hard to explain my thoughts perfectly in a foreign language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, our discussion led to nowhere, however I told them I&amp;#39;d try to further learn about this issue and thus spend a couple of hours on this topic today. This sadly didn&amp;#39;t really help, as most arguments genuinely didn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest argument I encountered was that cultural appropriation is so bad because it kind of devalues the symbolism behind the appropriated thing and thus is damaging to the culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However after thinking about it, I found myself completely disagreeing with it for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) If for example you see a caucasian dude with rastas, you see just that. You have no idea whether or not this person actually is a practicing rastafarian. Not a single person in the world knows unless you directly approach this person. So how does it devalue the symbolism when you have no chance of knowing for what reason a person wears rastas? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) In the circumstance that you approach the dude and ask him about the rastas and he really only has them for aesthetic reasons, how does it change the meaning of rastas? I mean if you&amp;#39;re a practicing rastafarian and meet someone with rastas who isn&amp;#39;t a practicing rastafarian, why does that devalue the symbol in your eyes? I genuinely don&amp;#39;t understand. The symbol still has the same meaning in your religion and will always have that meaning, nobody can change that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean look at the cross for example. It&amp;#39;s used on so many things these days, people get it tattooed for aesthetic reasons, yet it hasn&amp;#39;t lost it&amp;#39;s meaning for the christians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I have very little knowledge on this topic and maybe tackle the issue from an completely wrong viewpoint, but I always followed the principle to generally rate someone&amp;#39;s actions and behavior based on their intentions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get dreadlocks because you appreciate them and like how they look, in my eyes you&amp;#39;re golden. 
Once you however do things to explicitly disrespect or mock something of a different culture, you&amp;#39;re a cunt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like people choose to be offended, whereas another perspective could be to understand that imitation is the highest from of flattery. Isn&amp;#39;t it a good thing if someone sees something from a different culture and likes so much that he adopts it? &lt;/p&gt;

They document many studies on the topic of institutional/systemic racism and its existence. 

I've looked through several of these studies, and they seem to make a compelling case there are racial differences in how individuals are treated within systems like the justice system, education, etc. 

I am excited to hear feedback on either of these two documents. Some common criticism I hear is that these documents don't consider other races. For example, what if Asian people got shorter sentences than white?
To that I usually say, yes we'd need studies to confirm that, and if that exists, its wrong. But for now, we have definite proof that racism of black people as compared to white people exists, and that's a problem. Are there any studies that are more comprehensive or multivariate I should add to my arsenal? Are there studies I should eliminate due to weakness? 

These aren't even my documents, but I want to make a copy of this for myself (currently they are directly from other sources) and I want to create my own personal document that does a good job of addressing the common counterpoints to the best of its ability. I want to be able to convince rational, data driven people that systemic racism exists, if it does, but I'm also open to being proven wrong.

So, right now, we call people adults @ the age of 18.

Some states however say that the age for their citizens to consent to sex is 16, some say higher, and some have different ages for cyber affiliations of pictures and videos etc. 

For something so serious, why do you think it's so staggered? 

Why is it that one state can even have different in-house ages for either physical consent and cyber affiliation? One where say, 16 is their age for physical consent, and then 17 is their age for cyber intimacy. Do you view this as just right? Or maybe flip flopped? Or, should they be equal?

If you put 1 speaker of each language on earth (they solely speak that language and know no others) on an island together, and completely isolate that group from the outside world, how would they communicate? According to my quick research, there are 6,500+ different languages spoken on earth, so there would be an equal number of people on this experimental island.

Over multiple generations would their language end up at a sort of least common denominator? Or would the children born to the first generation ultimately be able to translate between multiple languages and be a bridge of sorts to a common language? Would a creole of sorts develop?

,AskSocialScience,"Hi everyone! I'm not a social sciences researcher, so my apologies if I'm talking about anything in the wrong way or if I'm simply asking the wrong questions, but I'm hoping that by narrowing the scope of my questions to a particular study it will help guide my questions and the answers a little bit more explicitly. 

For some background, my friends and I have been having back and forth arguments about [this study (Kang, et al, 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298795100_Whitened_Resumes_Race_and_Self-Presentation_in_the_Labor_Market) for a while now. Specifically, the data collection and presentation in ""Experiment 3"" of this resume study. 

The study, in short, is looking at the impacts of ""whitening"" resumes on a POC's callback rate. Things like obscuring an African American or Asian name with initials or a similar ""white-sounding"" name, changing out ""African American Business Leaders"" with ""Business Leaders"" for clubs and activities, etc. We can't seem to get to the bottom of it or have a productive discussion about the findings because some of my friends doubt the validity of the methods/sample sizes. 

After long hours of heated debate, I think we've gotten down to the crux of it that I can try to simplify into a single question: is the sample size sufficiently large enough to account for the uncontrollable variables in this study's methods and if so, how can we determine this to be the case? I have a few questions for you all to help guide me, so I hope you can help.

1. Is it typical in social sciences to not include a section saying ""here's what our sample size is and here's *why* it is significant/sufficient to account for uncontrollable factors.""? 

2. Is there a way that I, as a lay person, can determine that for myself in studies that don't include that sort of section?

3. If there is a way to do #2 with this study, how would I go about doing that? Is there a standard or preferred method or is it on a case-by-case basis? 

4. Are there any other pieces of analysis that I ought to do when looking at studies like these to better understand how ""strong"" the data/study is at a methodological level? 

I'd really like to be a piece of the puzzle for my friends/colleagues and help push these sorts of conversations forward in a grounded way. They tend to devolve into these awful ""well the study doesn't account for this, so we don't know if there's a better explanation than what you're proposing"" types of back and forth nit-picking arguments, and they get stale, and heated really quickly. I think most of it is borne out of our collective ignorance within the social sciences and research in general that makes it impossible for us to get to that next step of discussion.

,AskSocialScience," It seems to me that to be able to participate in the arts and humanities,  one must be able to meet conditions such as the quality of education in  one's environment, how supportive is the environment to the pursuit of  wanting to engage in those fields (either academically or  non-academically), and whether or not they have access to knowledge of  such subjects themselves in general.

An  example of this would be the fact that a large majority of people in  the art industry that work on animation (i.e. storyboard artists,  background painters, etc.) tend to be middle-upper class cosmopolitan  urbanites. To able to pursue such careers (much less considering  pursuing such careers in the first place), I think, requires some degree  of societal privilege. Another example that comes to mind would be to  contemplate on how there may be thousands of extremely great artists and  writers out there that lack the means to distribute their work due to  societal conditions.

What I'm  interested in is how does this system of exclusion caused by inequality  of opportunity influence such subjects overall. So far the only  philosophical work I'm familiar with that somewhat touches on this is  Foucault's idea of genealogy/archeology that has some sort of a basis on  viewing history for a lens of exclusion and marginality, Beauvoir's  views on subjugation in The Second Sex, and Gramsci's work on cultural  hegemony.

To able to pursue such careers (much less considering  pursuing such careers in the first place), I think, requires some degree  of societal privilege. Another example that comes to mind would be to  contemplate on how there may be thousands of extremely great artists and  writers out there that lack the means to distribute their work due to  societal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m  interested in is how does this system of exclusion caused by inequality  of opportunity influence such subjects overall. So far the only  philosophical work I&amp;#39;m familiar with that somewhat touches on this is  Foucault&amp;#39;s idea of genealogy/archeology that has some sort of a basis on  viewing history for a lens of exclusion and marginality, Beauvoir&amp;#39;s  views on subjugation in The Second Sex, and Gramsci&amp;#39;s work on cultural  hegemony. I&amp;#39;d like to know if there&amp;#39;s any works that touches more on  this specific subject—anything similar would also help.&lt;/p&gt;

,AskSocialScience,"Social media and news media have been painting an extremely dark picture of the world as of late, America in particular.  The picture is so dark, in fact, that I feel increasingly worried that there a breakdown in American democracy is imminent, if it isn't already here.  However, considering how these sources inflate or exaggerate issues, favoring emotional punch over nuance, I wanted to get the perspective of people who would probably be better able to assess the situation.  These are the subjects which have most recently given me cause for concern:

* The border detention camps appear to be precursors to concentration camps, if they aren't concentration camps already.  They way they are operated, and the people staffing them, appear to be distillations of sadistic cruelty.

* Police brutality has been an ever-present issue in America, but as far as I'm aware it's only recently come into mainstream attention.  However, attempts to rectify the issue seem to have only [escalated the brutality](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/police-violence-protests-us-george-floyd).  The deployment of federal troops in protesting cities seems to have been a continuation and escalation of this issue.

* The severe—and increasing—wealth inequality, and corresponding concentration of power into ever-more powerful oligopolies.  This seems to present two dangers:  one of revolution, and one of economic collapse.  In the past, severe wealth inequality has been a contributing factor of revolutions as disenfranchised people finally get fed up.  Even if we aren't in danger of such a revolution, though, it seems that the economy is an increasingly top-heavy Jenga tower with only a few rotting pegs to hold the entire thing up.  If the poorest people get much poorer, or occupy a larger proportion of the population, I find it hard to imagine how the economy could continue to function.

* Polarization and media bubbles.  It seems that the country is split into two halves operating off of fundamentally different and increasingly contradictory axioms and values.  Two incompatible subcultures within America seems to be a guarantee of long-term instability.

* The American government's gross mishandling of the pandemic, and the decisions of large segments of the population to practically ignore it.  This seems to have mostly highlighted the cracks in American democracy, but also to have deepened them and produced significant short-term instability.

* Corruption, cronyism, and abuse of power throughout the government.  Older issues and concerns of mine which suggest long-term instability include gerrymandering, and media bubbles/polarization.  An example that come to mind is President Trump's continuous obstructions and derailment of investigations against him.  More recently I've become concerned about oligopolies wielding seemingly absolute power over politicians and the political process—as with [Robert Duncan serving a Mitch McConnell super-PAC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/usps-chair-robert-duncan-is-director-for-mcconnell-linked-super-pac.html).  It feels as though the damage to the country's institutions is irreparable, and that the democratic decay runs so deep as to be incurable.

* [Russian interference with American elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials) and the apparent eagerness of American officials to let them—[*help*] them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/us/politics/senate-intelligence-russian-interference-report.html)—do it.  At the very least, America is vulnerable to foreign interference, at worst, a handful of Americans have given the reigns of the political process to a foreign power for their own personal gain.  In either case, America and its institutions lose autonomy and seem to be pushed down a path meant to weaken and destabilize.

Many warning signs of a collapse that I learned from history classes appear to be present:  inequality, corruption, rising authoritarianism, consolidation of power, and large segments of the population feeling as though they've lost both their dignity and way of life.

Even &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_and_etiquette_in_Indian_dining""&gt;Indian cultures&lt;/a&gt; enforce the same idea when it comes to Indian dining but there is no clear reason why this is the case &lt;/li&gt;

,AskSocialScience,"I notice that within psychology, and adjacent fields such as behavioral biology, causal explanations of behavior often confound the evolutionary purpose and the psychological motive behind behavior. 

To give an example: ""Male lions kill the offspring of other males so that they can have more offspring themselves.""

In reality, a lion is not interested in increasing the number of descendants it produces. The psychological motive of the lion may be to have lionesses going into heat earlier again, since mating is likely a rewarding activity. This is assuming the lion even understands the connection between killing offspring and mating opprtunities which arise at a later point in time. 

It seems like this lack of differentiation also leads to the compulsive search for the evolutionary purpose of any observed behavior, be it in animals or humans. Examples which come to mind are attempts to explain suicide in humans. I suppose it can not be categorically ruled out that suicide serves an evolutionary purpose, however, the evolutionary explanations of suicide I have encountered seem rather implausible to me. It seems much more likely that suicide is a non-adaptive byproduct of the complex nature of human thought and behavior than a reproductive advantage.

If we acknowledge that psychological motives serve as a degree of seperation between observed behavior and evolutionary selectional forces, it becomes obvious that some behaviors are simply not adaptive in terms of reproductive fitness, but rather random byproducts of behavior.

not quite sure whether this is a proper subreddit for asking this question but I think it might be a concept that has been described in social sciences. So here it goes:

By that I mean certain provisions are followed to the letter, others aren't and what you get is an implementation of the guidelines that doesn't quite match the guidelines as specified.

So basically when you discuss whether ""guideline X"" is a valuable method worth implementing, this is a repeated pattern.

* some say its good
* others provide examples of instances where people didn't feel like it was valuable
* Proponents blame the implementors, as being responsible for the trouble because the implementors wouldn't follow the guideline truthfully / exact
* opponents blame the method for being systematically hard to implement / follow.

,AskSocialScience,"The theory goes like this, evolution favours characteristics that promote the survival of the given  species right? And we have desire to seek out these characteristics in friends or partners because that maximises our own chances of survival and our children's. 

We watch TV because that gives us knowledge that we can use in social situations which is a form of power that would have been useful in early humans to help us survive ( the ability to influence and lead others), we go to the gym because that gives us physical power over other men, we aspire to high level careers because that gives us social and economic power.  So the question is, why did evolution favour a species that looks for power in so many different places? My answer :power = sex, and sex= the survival of the human race, and even if that's not something you think about, or something you want,  the unconscious mind leads you towards it like squirrels hibernating. 

Now some humans don't want to have sex, this doesn't mess up my theory because sex= the survival of the human race, and using power there are other ways to do this, that's why we feel good when we give to the homeless, or help a stranger on the street. Those who are asexual as it were, still do everything because of prolonging humanity, just in a different way.

In my opinion this leads to the conclusion that humans are naturally collective,  because socialisation leads different people to look for power in different places, and any one of these forms of power are useless on their own, what's strength with out intellect? What's ingenuity without the ability to lead? So we need all of our forms of power together to survive.

,AskSocialScience,"Hey guys I had a query about market prices,substitute goods,producer surplus 

Let’s say there are two substitute goods in a market,CocaCola and Pepsi. According to theory in which I learned when the price of let’s say Coca Cola rises from 5$ to 10$, then the quantity demanded decreases . And there is a shift to the demand curve of Pepsi to the right, because it appears cheaper , which will lead to Pepsi price rise from 5$ to 7.5$ . My question is why would those people who buy cola still prefer buying it if it’s higher priced, cause I assumed it’s Ceterus Paribus and we don’t assume factors like consumer preferences where a consumer like cola more than Pepsi . 

Additionally this is a bit off topic but what exactly is a market price . I understand it’s determined by the supply and demand in the market , however there are different suppliers in the market like for t shirts someone might sell at a higher price and someone sell at a cheaper price , how can there be one market price though.
Like in the above example is market price 7.5 or 10?

- Producer surplus : I am a bit unclear about producer surplus . Is producer surplus the difference in price a producer is willing to accept for the good compared to the market price. So in this statement if I imagine the supply curve for the market , and below the market price level and above the supply curve I shade the producer surplus . But at the market price each producer who was willing to supply at a lower price will increase its individual quantity supplied at a point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost , so at that quantity while selling it why would they accept a lower price , how are they still in surplus?

,AskSocialScience,"Hey guys I had a query about supply and demand and equilbrium points.

Whenever there are shifts in the supply / demand curves, for me it get's very confusing because I overthink the movements along the curve. 

Like for example a good is priced at $14 and the tax is $6. Is it that the producer continues to produce the quanity of good at his original price at $14 and due to tax charges $20. Then assuming elastic demand, demand decreases to some x value, then he receives a signal, and then over time he reduces prices and production until new equilbrium price. Or when he receives the news of a new  tax of $6, he only raises the price a little bit perhaps to $15 and reduces production to new equilbrium point. I hope you guys understand the question I am asking, because I understand tax incidence and all when it's inelastic and elastic demand, my main question is Does the supplier knowing there is elastic demand :

a) decreases production to new equilbrium point (more like a jump from intial equilbrium point to another)

OR

b)continues production and waits for signal and the price mechanism happens.

What is the role of social sciences given the lack of predictability in these fields?

Current political scientists feel, in the public eye, fairly useless these days. Given their lack of predictive powers, as seen in the 2016 election, the black box that is modern day economics, and ambiguity on the most simple (but not easy) questions in the the public sphere (“how can we change race relations?”), what is the role of social sciences?

Of course, those dealing with a scientific approach to these questions have to deal with far more factors than someone like an engineer. When calculating the trajectory of a rocket, one can estimate thrust, lift, drag, air resistance, create a model and have a definite result. With the trajectory of an election, one has to quantify political scandals, the impact of social media, unexpected barriers to the voting process. It is far more complicated by the nature of the question, and essentially impossible to answer qualitative questions in a satisfactory quantitative or binary way.

Any reading on the topic would be really welcome as well! Thank you for reading.


reply to deleted comment which elaborated a bit more of my train of thought, correctly saying I mischaracterized what science is:

I guess I am talking about public perception of science as being primarily quantitatively based. However given the change in tools used to analyze the most impactful changes in society that social science addresses, I suppose this is also what I am more interested in.

I guess an example of my line of thinking is the past twenty years of behavioral economics (a very “sexy” topic these days). It seems as though the most interesting spheres where this is being studied in successfully predictive ways is not in academic settings at all, rather via private companies like Facebook determining what color of blue or what pages you are likely to interact with.

More and more frequently academic spheres seem to correctly acknowledge a lack of predictability, for example when Danny Kahneman was asked how his research on decision making lead him personally to better decisions, he replied that he didn’t believe it did at all.

But slavery has not lead to the racial issues in those other countries  post-emancipation, that we have had in America in the century and a half since the Civil War (If there are exceptions I'm ignorant of, feel free to point them out).

Why? I can think of several thesis:

Pure demographics - If African-Americans had been double the percentage of American the population they actually are, then they would have had more power, and things here would have looked a lot more like, say, Brazil.

The fact that we fought an especially bloody Civil War over the issue.

The failure of reconstruction under Andrew Jackson and beyond

Specific oppressive laws

I'm visiting my dad's side of family and see the book ""Civilisation and its Discontents"" on my stepsister's table. I'm delighted to discover that she shares the same interest in social sciences as I do, but I don't think this book is a great introductory text to any field.  
  
Aside from it being possibly a hard read, it's written from a period where methodologies were not as developed as today. Also we're from China. Schools don't teach critical thinking. A high schooler may very likely take what's in a book as ""the truth"". I also think the activity of reading books without knowing some context can do some harms. For example, if a highschooler in China encounters a misogynist point of view in a book written by an authoritive figure, they might take it at its face value. Whereas if they know the book was written in a period where misogyny was rampant, they could take some distance from the point of view.    

Obviously I don't want to destroy her interest by commenting on her choice, so I'm hoping to recommend some books for her that are interesting, have less biases and more scientific rigour. It could be from any field, she doesn't know what to study in University so I'm hoping to help her discover some choices. It should be preferably not a theoretical text, but focus on one or more concrete questions, provides some context in the field and applies modern methodologies in its investigation.

,AskSocialScience,"In my Brazilian context, what would be called the ''traditional'' right is a very ardent economic neoliberalism that is accompanied by mild social conservatism. The formula of the alt-right is inverted with economic isolation and strong emphasis on social morals.  It is usually accompanied by populism, restrictions on civil liberties and militarism. Most importantly, the alt-right defines itself as against the establishment and the traditional right's economic policy and thought is more directly dependent on academia. I think we all know what I am talking about but I clarify anyway for the purposes of allowing discussion.              

I have numerous hypothesis, which I seek confirmation or invalidation, one of them is that this is an extension of the Cold War and associated with the Balkans.    

 The soviet occupation, ethnic rivalries and conflict with people of Ottoman descent created a powerful cocktail of anticommunism, anti-islamism, elements of racism and authoritarian rule in that region. The war against terrorism promoted by the USA in my mind gave these ideas strength in the public sphere and soon infected the entirety of Eastern Europe. Russia, already an illiberal wannabe superpower, served as a vehicle through which these ideas could be exported through the wider world from their close relations with south slavs. Poland, which repugnates Russia, was still a hotstop of ethnic nationalism so it did not serve as a buffer zone.               

Thus, the US became illiberal facing the threat of terrorism, while Russia and Eastern Europe were already illiberal. The role of China is uncertain in all this. They have limited influence in Southeast Asia because of their imperialistic past and even less in India. While Central Asia is more prone to influence, Russia is already a key ideological influencer. 

I'm also reminded of Gaddafi. In many ways he promoted a kind of ''alt-left'' that took elements of nationality and religion that would be despiced by soviets and put them on the center of his doctrine. Could it be that the alt-right takes his principles of anti-western resistance and apply them to the west itself? How did that happen?

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the US became illiberal facing the threat of terrorism, while Russia and Eastern Europe were already illiberal. The role of China is uncertain in all this. They have limited influence in Southeast Asia because of their imperialistic past and even less in India. While Central Asia is more prone to influence, Russia is already a key ideological influencer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also reminded of Gaddafi. In many ways he promoted a kind of &amp;#39;&amp;#39;alt-left&amp;#39;&amp;#39; that took elements of nationality and religion that would be despiced by soviets and put them on the center of his doctrine. Could it be that the alt-right takes his principles of anti-western resistance and apply them to the west itself? How did that happen? Gadaffi was obviously not the first to do this but the degree of influence Ba&amp;#39;Ath would have is ambiguos if not for Libya bordering the Mediterranean...or for their friendly relations with Russia but to my knowledge they were limited before the Arab Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

Firstly, what exaclty does it mean by to impose a 25% tariffs on 250billion worth of chinese goods, is it like all the exports from CHina to USA will be 25% more in price. Addtiionally, are tariffs to raise costs or prices, is it like when the country in this case China, is exporting to US when it's right on the border(metaphorically) USA magically imposes tariffs and makes all their goods 25% more priced? Or china aware of it from before, and lowers production accordingly.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furthermore, one striking element about high school is that many people do not want to be there. Often students are &amp;quot;obliged&amp;quot; to be there due to their parents. Many of them have no interest in pursuing higher education would instead be working or playing sports. Hence this is one of the times where you&amp;#39;ll put different people into one group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colleges&lt;/strong&gt;: No dress codes, minimal to no test-taking, short hours, lax laws. Way less bullying unless you are part of a &amp;quot;subculture&amp;quot; like fraternities or sororities, where some hazing  can be common.

,AskSocialScience,"Recently a friend sent me an [Article](http://womanmeanssomething.com/transition-as-treatment-the-best-studies-show-the-worst-outcomes/) after I asked them about their opinion on transgender issues. Needless to say, it concerned me. The article seems to imply that most studies that support transitioning and clinical treatment for transgender people take place over short periods of time, have high rates of people not following up, and that those that go for longer and have more follow-up speak against the effectiveness of the treatment. They claim that the results show a [Honeymoon period](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19040622/) for transgender people, and cite [Nobili 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11154-018-9459-y) that lists only 2 of 29 studies as high quality.

The most important studies they detail are as follows.

**Low Quality Studies**

[Ruppin &amp; Pfafflin 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690443): This is named as an example of a study that loses several people to follow-up.

[Lindqvist 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00238-016-1252-0): In addition to low follow-up, they claim that SF-36 data indicates that the author's explanations for the drop-off in physical and mental components as being applicable to the general population are wrong.

**High Quality Studies**

[Asscheman 2011 (Netherlands)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266549): “total mortality was 51% higher than in the general population, mainly from increased mortality rates due to suicide, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cardiovascular disease, drug abuse, and unknown cause.”

[Dhejne 2011 (Sweden)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885): They acknowledge the drop-off in suicide in the 1989-2003 cohort, but dismiss this on the basis of other studies that speak to the contrary. 

[Rauchfleish 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9789272) [Lindemalm 1986](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542412) and  [Simonsen 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479779): All are listed despite their acknowledged low sample size.

[Adams 2017](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/trgh.2016.0036): “It seems counterintuitive, on the other hand, that suicide attempts are lower before transition (ideation 36.1%; attempt 13.1%) than over most other periods (past year attempts being the exception).”

 [Jellestad 2018 (Switzerland)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/8684625/): ""found not only a lower mental quality of life for the surgically-transitioned group than the general population, but that neither hormone treatment nor surgery predicted positive quality of life.""

[Auer 2013 (Germany)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078469): ""investigated a hormone treated clinical group, and in comparison with a control group found “significantly higher mean scores in all psychopathology subscales”, no matter which sex was used as comparison. ""

,AskSocialScience,"I don't feel like I have a hard time understanding any of [Geert Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions theory](https://geerthofstede.com), except for this specific dimension. It was originally called Masculinity, or the gamut of masculinity—femininity. Hofstede and his followers, though, took pains to warn readers that this variable was not a reliable indicator of women's freedom relative to men's in that culture. From what I can gather, there is some correlation to that culture's socially acceptable gender roles, but it's not simple or direct. Some Hofstedians have attempted to rename this variable to ease confusion. I've seen ""quantity-of-life cultures vs. quality-of-life cultures"" and ""task-oriented vs. people-oriented"" suggested.

That helps a bit, but a question I have is, how is MAS an independent variable? I haven't done the math to back this up and am mediocre at statistics, but I hypothesize that high MAS is actually just a product of moderate-to-high individualism (INV), moderate-to-high power distance (PDI), and moderate to high indulgence (IND). Find me a culture that's high on all these but low on MAS, and I'll eat my crow-feathered hat.

I'll take a stab at *my* sense of what MAS means in layman's terms. Please attack it; I'd like to learn something:
In cultures that score high on MAS, it is incumbent upon all males, and optional for females, to cultivate a mindset and life attitude befitting a capable hunter or warrior. There are fewer social limits on the strategic use of harm to achieve one's aims. People aim to objectively outrank each other on hard metrics, rather than aiming to subjectively feel better as a primary end. Inequality is to be expected, as a natural product of competition, which itself is natural and good. It's a dog-eat-dog world, and who has more power than whom is the only real, objective measure of who has played the game of life better, on the level of one's social circle or the whole world just the same.
In low MAS cultures, by contrast, subjective wellbeing — being at peace with oneself and at peace with the world around oneself — is the primary goal, rather than a hoped-for secondary outcome of more objective, fact-based societal metrics. In low MAS cultures, it is incumbent upon all people, male and female, to be highly in tune with their own needs, and the needs of those around them, and be shrewd about when and what to contribute toward the greater good.

It was originally called Masculinity, or the gamut of masculinity—femininity. Hofstede and his followers, though, took pains to warn readers that this variable was not a reliable indicator of women&amp;#39;s freedom relative to men&amp;#39;s in that culture. From what I can gather, there is some correlation to that culture&amp;#39;s socially acceptable gender roles, but it&amp;#39;s not simple or direct. Some Hofstedians have attempted to rename this variable to ease confusion. I&amp;#39;ve seen &amp;quot;quantity-of-life cultures vs. quality-of-life cultures&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;task-oriented vs. people-oriented&amp;quot; suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That helps a bit, but a question I have is, how is MAS an independent variable? I haven&amp;#39;t done the math to back this up and am mediocre at statistics, but I hypothesize that high MAS is actually just a product of moderate-to-high individualism (INV), moderate-to-high power distance (PDI), and moderate to high indulgence (IND). Find me a culture that&amp;#39;s high on all these but low on MAS, and I&amp;#39;ll eat my crow-feathered hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll take a stab at &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; sense of what MAS means in layman&amp;#39;s terms. Please attack it; I&amp;#39;d like to learn something:
In cultures that score high on MAS, it is incumbent upon all males, and optional for females, to cultivate a mindset and life attitude befitting a capable hunter or warrior. There are fewer social limits on the strategic use of harm to achieve one&amp;#39;s aims. People aim to objectively outrank each other on hard metrics, rather than aiming to subjectively feel better as a primary end. Inequality is to be expected, as a natural product of competition, which itself is natural and good. It&amp;#39;s a dog-eat-dog world, and who has more power than whom is the only real, objective measure of who has played the game of life better, on the level of one&amp;#39;s social circle or the whole world just the same.

,AskSocialScience,"Hello!

First, to define *plural people*, is heard people who live in a *system* of several *alters*, occupying the same physical body.   
Clinically, that can refer to Dissociative Identity Disorder, or to other dissociative troubles.   
Non-clinically, it may refer to anyone who sees themselves having multiple *alters*/*""personalities""/headmates*, for a large amount of reasons, for example culture, religion (see *tulpamancy*), or even just 'it feels natural' (see *paromancy*).

Most of the studies I can find go very deeply into the clinical side, reasons DID exists and interactions with other troubles (eg ASD, schizophrenia, ...), but don't really aboard the simplest side of 'everyday life', how an individual living as a system is impacted during social life (work, relationships, etc etc).  
An evident impact would be the gender of such an individual, which might be the gender of the *main alter*, or a combination of everything, or something else. I already couldn't find any sort of study simply talking of the gender of these plural individuals (*this wording sounds odd, right?*).

My question mainly regards:   
\- What are studies that have been made regarding non-clinical plural people? What sort of tools have people used to observe this situation?  
\- Are there studies that have been conducted specifically on transgender and/or non-binary plural individuals, clinically or not?

&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The 1984 Rugby Tour of South Africa was organised by the
Rugby Football Union which invited individuals, including three
members of the club to join the tour. There were two views
about the tour amongst the opponents of apartheid. The view
taken by the council, a view which I share, was that the tour
would endorse the racist policies of the South African Government.
The opposite view was expressed by Mr. Dodge, who was one of
the three members of the club who participated in the tour and
who gave sworn evidence in these proceedings as follows:

&gt;&gt;""I personally deplore apartheid as being morally wrong. It is
nevertheless **my genuine belief that maintaining sporting
links with South Africa does help break down the evil social
barriers of apartheid**, a personal belief which has been
strengthened by observing in 1984 the improvement since
1980.""    

&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **The council agree that this belief was sincerely held not
only by Mr. Dodge but by other opponents of apartheid.** The
Government had subscribed to the Gleneagles agreement but did
not take steps to ban the tour, leaving the decision to each
individual invited to take part. The club does not practice racial
discrimination, does not support apartheid, has not been guilty of
any infringement of the Race Relations Act 1976, did not support
the decision of the three members to join the tour and sought to
discourage them from joining the tour by sending them copies of
the reasoned memorandum published by the opponents of the tour.
The council does not contend that the club should have threatened
or punished the three club members who participated in the tour
or that the club could properly have done so. Nevertheless, the
club has been punished by the council according Mr. Soulsby for
""failing to condemn the tour and to discourage its members from
playing."" My Lords, the laws of this country are not like the laws

Government had subscribed to the Gleneagles agreement but did
not take steps to ban the tour, leaving the decision to each
individual invited to take part. The club does not practice racial
discrimination, does not support apartheid, has not been guilty of
any infringement of the Race Relations Act 1976, did not support
the decision of the three members to join the tour and sought to
discourage them from joining the tour by sending them copies of
the reasoned memorandum published by the opponents of the tour.
The council does not contend that the club should have threatened
or punished the three club members who participated in the tour
or that the club could properly have done so. Nevertheless, the
club has been punished by the council according Mr. Soulsby for
&amp;quot;failing to condemn the tour and to discourage its members from
playing.&amp;quot; My Lords, the laws of this country are not like the laws
of Nazi Germany. A private individual or a private organisation
cannot be obliged to display zeal in the pursuit of an object
sought by a public authority and cannot be obliged to publish views
dictated by a public authority.&lt;/p&gt;

**Extremely Long Version:**

I'm currently conducting research on behalf if this [organization](https://snfpaideia.upenn.edu/initiatives/red-and-blue-exchange/).  We're hoping to ""build a movement"" of young people across the country who are interested in cross-party civil dialogue. While it's somewhat easy to find folks in any college who are interested in these tough discussions, it's quite difficult to keep them all informed and all discussing the best ways to engage folks who are actually there to argue.

It turns out, there's a science (very young and constantly developing science)  to engaging with others who don't share your opinion. As we continue to conduct research in this field and continue to learn from other folks trying it out, we need a way to share best practices, resources, etc. We also need a way to let others share their challenges, their successes, and so on.

It occurs to me that many professionals (doctors, scientists, etc.) might already be working in online communities they can share ideas, discuss ideas, perhaps even argue about ideas, but ultimately use as a resource to improve their work. I'm especially interested in how you connect with very niche concepts- for example, ""Race and Privilege"" is fairly well-trodden and likely easy to seek out new ideas. ""Race and Privilege in McDonald's playgrounds,"" however is much less common and, thus, anyone concerned with just that, must have a way to connect to the other few people studying it?

Any thoughts? Any links to well-designed online communities that are there to promote dialogue?

,AskSocialScience,"\[Edit: I meant ""Middle East and South Asia"" rather than ""the developing world"". Muslims in the Balkans and Central Asia (which *are* part of the developing world) are overwhelmingly secular.\]

This [2013 Pew poll](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) about world Muslim opinion of religion, politics and society offers an insight into the modern Islamic world. First of all: Do the poll's methodology, presentation and conclusion generally appear sound to you?

According to that poll, adopting sharia enjoys a great deal of popularity among Muslims outside of Europe and Central Asia, especially in the Middle East and South Asia where support is almost universal — though most agree it should only apply to Muslims. Still, a significant amount of Muslims supports the death penalty for apostasy (i.e. conversion from Islam) especially in Malaysia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine among countries polled.

And yet... When Muslims were asked if they valued religious freedom and the ability of non-Muslims to practice openly, 76% was the *lowest* recorded approval rate — with most over 90%. Moreover, when Muslims were asked if they thought targeting civilians was sometimes justified, 40% was the *highest* recorded approval rate — with most well below 30%. That's less than the \~55% approval rate recorded among Americans in a [2010 Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx).

Support for the execution of apostates *in spite of* general interfaith tolerance seems like a jarring juxtaposition to me. Is this a recent development related to the rise of Islamism in the '80s, or does it have deeper roots in regional history? I am reasonably familiar with Cold War-era MENA politics and I had never even come across the issue before — what was hot stuff back then was secular pan-Arabism, not murdering heretics.
