askscience,"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hwnhe2/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

askscience,"**TL;DR:** Last week was British Science Week! We are here to answer any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.

Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:** CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 97)!

askscience,"Obviously planets orbit the sun on nearly perfect keplerian orbits, I'm not questioning that. My question is in the fine details:

There's something that was bugging me about orbital mechanics with 3+ bodies: for instance, the ISS is orbiting the Earth in a nice round orbit around its center of mass: but the Moon is also orbiting the Earth in such a way that their barycenter is offset by a good 3000km. Obviously the Moon also pulls on the ISS, but somehow it doesn't seem to affect the point it orbits around. On the other hand, an object orbiting around a close binary system will orbit their center of mass, and not either of the two, which is the opposite result.

Of course those are extreme cases, but they made me raise the question of less extreme ones: Jupiter offsets the solar system's center so much it can come out of the Sun. Does Saturn orbit that point, or does it orbit the Sun still? What about Mars, or the asteroid belt? **Is there a way to know which point of space an object can be best said to orbit?**

My intuition would tell me that the equivalent mass that governs the shape and speed of the orbit is one at the center of mass of all bodies **within** that orbit (eg the Sun + all inner planets and objects), with no net change to that from outer objects, which is the best way I could think of to reconcile the two extreme cases and it also seems coherent with Gauss' law. Is that inuition correct?

For instance, I'd see Mercury as orbiting the Sun, with not net influence from any other object apart from perturbations. But does the orbit of Venus accelerate in such a way that it's as if the mass of Mercury was added to that of the Sun? In other words, is it more correct to consider Mercury as simply perturbing Venus' orbit around the Sun, or as increasing the effective mass and position of the Sun by its own mass, or perhaps by a different amount depending on how close it is to the orbit of Venus?

&amp;#x200B;

The hippocampus is in charge of long term memory. The more things you study/memorize, it actually gets bigger. So if I wanted to learn ""How does multiplication work"" or ""Who are all of the named characters on Game of Thrones,"" the hippocampus holds onto that information. 

The prefrontal cortex is in charge of short term memory. So let's assume I already know how multiplication works. And I need to answer the question... 

**""It takes 25 toothpicks to make one Iron Throne replica. It takes 20 more toothpicks to make a second Iron Throne replica that attaches alongside the first one like Legos. And 20 more toothpicks for a third Iron Throne, 20 more for a fourth, on and on. So how many toothpicks will you need to make 21 total Iron Thrones, sandwiched together in a row?""**

The prefrontal cortex is where I would keep track of the figures that tell me ""21 Thrones... the first one has 25 toothpicks... so that's 25 toothpicks plus 20 more Thrones worth of toothpicks... it goes up by 20 each time... 20 times 20 is 400... that's 400 + 25.

Among the observations that scientists have been making, there is that such statistics does not show anomalies as thrombosis happens on an even higher frequency regardless.

Long story short, I arrived at  y = x\^(1/x) as the function I need the maximum ""y"" value of.  I was lazy, so I homed in on the ""x"" any ""y"" values simply by using a calculator and trying numbers. After about 20 steps, I got  1.44466786 as ""y"" and 2.71815 as ""x"". 

I was really surprised that I homed in on ""e"". This also means, that for infinitley many tetration of the same value as in x\^x\^x\^x..., the maximum finite value is ""e"", and the ""x"" value where this happens is e\^(1/e). Which is very interesting.

askscience,"I apologize if this question has already been asked, i could not find any threads or concrete answers about this (or maybe i just didn't understand them :).

So, i've been reading about the mechanism of the new Adenoviral vector vaccines (AZ, J&amp;J, etc). From all explanations i've read, this is my (very simplistic) understanding:

1. Modified adenovirus enters the cell
2. DNA is injected in the nucleus
3. mRNA is ""generated"" and exits the nucleus
4. Cell starts producing and expressing spike protein
5. Immune response is provoked

What i'm wondering is, basically, what exactly happens with the cell after that:

Does the viral DNA degrade at some point?

Once this DNA is in the cell's nucleus, for how long is step 3 executed?

Since those vaccines are administered in the muscle, i'm guessing it's exactly the muscle cells that get 'infected' and start expressing the spike protein.  And from a very quick search, it seems that the lifetime of a muscle cell is 10-15 years. 

I guess a bonus question would be, once the cell expresses the spike protein, does the immune system kill it or persistently continues trying to?

But as I was doing research I learned that rifts can form at weak faults within a continental plate and create rifting (such as what’s happening with the East African Rift system). Though most rifts form from a massive upwelling of mantle, similar to a flood basalt but actually tearing the plate apart. 

During that research I also saw diagrams during the current plate movements and saw that the plate my area is actually centred in is moving in two different directions: the west side southeast but the east end west.

askscience,"Hi Reddit! We just published a study on live two-way communication with lucid dreamers - [watch VIDEO of the experiment here](https://youtu.be/7M06fJxiayo?t=501). AUA!

Hi! My name is Karen Konkoly and I'm a third-year PhD student in Ken Paller's cognitive neuroscience lab at Northwestern University. My projects focus on lucid dreaming and how it can be used to learn more about sleep, dreams, and consciousness more broadly.  I've been studying lucid dreaming for 7 years - since my sophomore year of college - when I attended an 8-day lucid dreaming retreat in Hawaii to garner ideas for my undergraduate senior thesis. (I subsequently concluded that the research was awesome.) The following summer, I worked at Brown University as a William E. Dement sleep research apprentice, and I gave a TEDx talk on lucid dreaming that fall. In my senior thesis, I taught participants to lucid dream in a month-long course, and I found that participants tended to feel less stressed and more vigorous the day after they had a lucid dream. After graduating from Lehigh, I interned at the Neuroscience and Psychology of Sleep lab at Cardiff University in Wales, assisting with an overnight project on presenting sounds during REM sleep. While in Wales, I also collaborated with researchers at nearby Swansea University to develop a new method of inducing lucid dreams. This method, dubbed Targeted Lucidity Reactivation, was able to induce lucid dreams in half of the participants in a single nap session. Now at Northwestern, I'm testing new methods and applications for communicating with dreamers.

Hi there, Reddit! I'm Ken Paller, a Professor at Northwestern University, where I hold the James Padilla Chair in Arts &amp; Sciences and serve as director of the training program in the neuroscience of human cognition. I'm a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, a Senior Fellow of the Mind and Life Institute, and was awarded the Senator Mark Hatfield Award from the Alzheimer's Association. My research has focused on human memory and consciousness - using a variety of methods including electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging - and my findings have contributed to understanding features of conscious memory experiences as well as ways in which memory operations differ in the absence of awareness of memory retrieval, as in implicit-memory priming, intuition, and implicit social bias. I've published nearly 200 scientific articles, reviews, and book chapters, some of which you can find on [my lab website](https://pallerlab.psych.northwestern.edu/). Some of my research has concerned patients with memory disorders, including evidence linking memory deficits to poor sleep. Recent studies from my lab showed that memory processing during sleep can reinforce prior learning, providing novel evidence on sleep's role in memory.

Our [most recent paper](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00059-2) described innovative research on two-way communication during REM sleep. We demonstrated the feasibility of real-time dialogue between an experimenter and someone in the midst of a lucid dream. Experimenters asked questions for which the correct answer was known so that we could determine whether effective communication was achieved. When dreamers responded, their answers were given via eye movements or facial muscle twitches - and they were usually correct. The first successful two-way communication during sleep was achieved in the lab in the early morning of January 9th, 2019. Karen gave Christopher Mazurek, a research participant and now a member of the lab group, the math problem 8 minus 6, which Christopher answered correctly. (At the time, we were unaware of similar studies in Germany by Kris Appel and in France by Delphine Oudiette and colleagues. Later, we decided to publish our results together.) Further applications of this method, which NOVA PBS captured for the first time on film in a [digital documentary on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M06fJxiayo) and [wrote about in an article](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/lucid-dreaming-communication/), can now probe conscious dream experiences as they happen, and who knows what else!

askscience,"Hello all,

I'm having a hard time trying to make sense of the mechanism of the Na+/K+ pump. So what I know is that there is a higher concentration of K+ in the interior of cell and oppositely the interior has a a lower concentration of Na+. So naturally, K+ ion will want to move outside of the cell and Na+ ions will want to move inside. However, the Na+/K+ pump moves Na+ and K+ ions against their ""wills"". I'm vaguely aware that this is an active transport meaning ATP is required to carry it out but I'm not sure why such energy  must be used for this. Why not just let them move according to their concentration gradients? 

I was trying to explain this to myself and I thought about the fact that the interior of cell is electrically negative as compared to the extracellular fluid. This one I'm not sure what it means. Does being electrically negative mean that in total there are move negative charges inside the cell than outside? If so, cell would try to direct more positive charges towards the inside. That might be why 2 K+ ions are moved in. However, it doesn't make sense as 3 K+ ions are pumped out. So in total there's a net loss of positive ions inside the cell? Also Does being electrically negative mean that in total there are move negative charges inside the cell than outside? I'm very confused by this.

In summary, I would like to ask 3 questions 

1. Why does the Na+/K+ pump move Na+ and K+ against their concentration gradient? 
2. Does the interior of the cell being electrically negative mean that in total there are move negative charges inside the cell than outside?
3. why is the ratio of Na+ out vs K+ in 3:2?

I am deeply appreciative of all the helps I can get. I've been tossing and turning all night trying to make sense of this but to no avail. Also I've just started learning about membranes and action potentials a few days ago so simple explanations are much encouraged.

Say a rocket moves away from Earth at 99% the speed of light and I then shine a laser towards that rocket. Once that laser catches up to the rocket, will it be observed to travel at 1% the speed of light since we are already moving at 99% the speed? I understand that the speed of light remains constant for everyone but if we observe it to travel at 100% the speed of light from the rocket, doesn't that mean that it is technically moving faster than the speed of light?

askscience,"Hi! I am Tel Aviv University cancer biologist, Prof. Neta Erez. I study the tumor metastasis microenvironment.

Tumors are more than just a bunch of cancer cells. They are better described as multicellular organisms. In each tumor there are complex interactions with immune cells, which cause inflammation processes in the connective tissue and blood vessels.

In my lab, we study these interactions to understand how tumor cells ""hijack"" physiological pathways and use them to support their growth. Additionally, we also study the link between cancer and inflammation,specifically how cancer cells metastasize and grow in distant organs from their original host.

Prof. Erez studies the biology of tumor metastasis, focusing on the metastatic microenvironment, cancer-related inflammation and the role of stromal and immune cells in facilitating the early and late stages of metastasis. Prof. Erez's work focuses on these crucial aspects of cancer. She uses mouse models of carcinogenesis and metastasis of melanoma, breast, and ovarian carcinoma. The main goal of her research is to identify and characterize key molecular pathways in the communication between tumor cells and their microenvironment that can be targeted by novel therapeutics.

Prof. Erez began her academic career at the Weizmann Institute of Science. She obtained her PhD in the field of molecular cell biology under the guidance of Prof. Varda Rotter.  Supported by a fellowship from the Cancer Research Institute (CRI), Prof. Erez carried out her postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Prof. Doug Hanahan at UCSF, working in the field of tumor biology (2005-2010). During her postdoctoral fellowship she demonstrated a novel role for cancer-associated fibroblasts in mediating tumor-promoting inflammation. Following her postdoctoral work, she joined the Department of Pathology at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in October 2010, and currently serves as the Department Chair.

askscience,"Hi Reddit! I'm Herman Pontzer, PhD, Associate Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and Associate Research Professor of Global Health at the Duke Global Health Institute. I conduct research on the human metabolism through studies with hunter-gatherer tribes like the Hadza in Africa.

In my decade of study in this field, what I've learned challenges the consensus of the diet and exercise industry. We've always been told that exercise increases the number of calories we burn each day, but a [doubly labeled water study with the Hadza](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040503) conducted by me and my research team shows that our bodies have evolved to adjust to our daily level of physical activity, thereby adjusting our metabolism to keep daily energy expenditure within a narrow range, regardless of how active we are. Instead, the key to losing weight and battling the obesity pandemic is regulating the number of calories we consume versus how many we burn. That's not to say we should abandon exercise - it is essential to keeping our bodies healthy and to aging well - but diet is the tool we need to focus on to manage our weight.

My new book, [*BURN*]( https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Research-Really-Calories-Healthy/dp/0525541527/), examines this exciting research taking place outside of traditional labs and reveals how a new understanding of our metabolism can inform our efforts to promote a healthy and sustainable society.

Please excuse me if this is a dumb question, but:

However, my textbook doesn’t highlight why a sex steroid would need to bind to DNA. 

What role does this play in the overall conformation of DNA?
Does the complex affect replication/transcription? And if yes, why would it need to do so?

askscience,"In college I learned that in order for nuclear fusion to start happening you need the energy of your electrons to be high enough to overcome the Coulomb potential, so that they can interact with the nucleus of atoms. The equation (3/2)nkT = e^2 /r gives a temperature of ~10^10 K, but taking into account quantum tunneling and using the de Broglie wavelength as the radius of the nucleus, you can get a much lower temperature of ~10^7 K. 

That's pretty close to the temperatures observed in the corona. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem) even mentions that the corona is 10^6 K and parts of it can reach even of 10^7 K, though doesn't have a source attached to it. 

So does that mean that there are parts of the corona the can fuse hydrogen?

askscience,"So in relativity there is an equation that links momentum, mass (rest mass), and energy together.  It is:

E^(2) = (PC)^(2) \+ (m\*C^(2))^(2)    (with E = energy, P = momentum, m = rest mass, and C = the speed of light)

One thing that stands out immediately is that it is the form of the pythagorean theorem. Namely,  that Energy is the hypotenuse and the sides are PC (momentum times the speed of light) and mC^(2) (the classic old E=mC^(2) energy.)  I know many physicists have a ""shut-up and calculate"" type of approach to these type of questions, but what does this relationship actually mean? Is there a commonly accepted interpretation of this? What does this imply about the world? To me this seems like a deep and interesting relationship, but I can't find anyone or anything really talking about it online aside from calling it ""Einstein's triangle"" or just pointing the relationship out.. The [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation) shows a [picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation#/media/File:Einstein-triangle-kinetic-energy.svg) which illustrates the relationship and calls it ""Einstein's Triangle"", but not really anything explaining what it actually means.

&amp;#x200B;

If I squint my eyes and handwave a bunch, to me it seems like PC is the spatial energy component and mC^(2) is the time energy component and since they are orthogonal they form a right triangle. But why is the total relativistic energy the hypotenuse?  I know one way of ""seeing"" relativity is that you and everything is always ""moving"" around at the speed of light, we just ""move"" more of our time energy and ""velocity"" to spatial dimensions. In which case, I could see a type of constant hypotenuse like relationship similar to if you are always walking around one step at a time, but just in different directions. The X and Y movements would change, but the hypotenuse is always one step.  However, I still don't see why that would imply energy as the hypotenuse?  Why can we look at this in a euclidean like way?

1. If radon is radioactive, and leaves radioactive material in your body, why does it mainly (only?) cause lung cancer?


2. If radon is 8x heavier than air, and mostly accumulates in the basement, wouldn't that mean that radon is a non-issue for people living on higher levels?


3. [This map](https://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/rhm/basic-info/1st/02-05-07.html) shows radon levels around the world. Why is radon so diverse across a small continent like Europe, yet wholly consistent across a massive country like Russia? Does it have to do with measuring limitations or architecture, or is the ground there weirdly uniform? 


4. If radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, why doesn't the  [map](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/28/10/1563.figures-only)of worldwide lung cancer cases coincide with the map of most radon heavy countries?  It seems to coincide wholly with countries that smoke heavily and nothing else. I base this one the fact that if you look at second chart, which is lung cancer incidence in females, the lung cancer cases in some countries like Russia, where smoking is much more prevalent among men, drop completely. Whereas lung cancer rates in scandinavia, far and away the most radon heavy place on earth, are not high to begin with.

I’m in the J&amp;J 2-shot COVID vaccine clinical trial. (It’s double blinded, so I don’t know whether I got the real vaccine or a control placebo.) I just got my second shot today. One of the things the nurses said, both times I got a shot, is that if my arm was sore right after the shot, it’s more likely that it’s the real vaccine.

It could be psychosomatic, of course, but I’m still curious, why does the shot hurt more when it’s real? Is it just because the body’s immune response is *that* fast? I figured the pain was a normal response to the skin being pierced and to having a shot, but if that’s the case then both the real deal and the control would hurt the same amount.

I've recently learned (if I'm not misunderstanding it) that superfluid helium-4 is a macroscopic quantum-coherent phenomenon, i.e. once cooled enough, the helium atoms are described by one wavefunction.

I realize that we don't yet have data on the COVID vaccines in particular.  But in general, how much does alcohol consumption actually affect immunity in response to vaccinations (e.g., development of antibodies and memory t-cells)?

A lot of people are drinking a lot more than usual recently, due to the pandemic.  So, three separate questions would be:

1. How does moderate drinking affect vaccine efficacy (e.g., 1-2 drinks per day)?  From online sources, it seems like the impact would be minimal.

2. How would a binge or two a few days after the vaccine affect its efficacy?  Would this completely undermine antibody and t-cell development?

askscience,"Hello, I was looking for stats on this topic, but struggled to find anything that really fit the bill. My question mostly pertains to the developed world, although I imagine the trends involved are global to varying degrees. I'm also excluding physical disability due to aging, because that seems like it obscures the overall picture (unless, I suppose, 80-year-olds today are more or less likely to be disabled than 80-year-olds a hundred years ago)

It occurred to me the other day that many of the factors that caused lifelong physical disability in the past are now largely controlled. Most infectious diseases that caused disability in children, like polio, meningitis, and mumps, are now either gone from the developed world or relatively rare. Additionally, a number of other causes of disability, like growth hormone disorders, are now routinely identified and treated in childhood.

We've also improved health and safety and environmental regulations, which means you'd think fewer people are disabled due to workplace injuries or preventable exposure to contaminants (lead, for example). Another example of a cause of disability that is decreasing in incidence are neural tube defects, due in part to the US and a few other countries introducing folate fortification.

My guess from all of this is that the number of people per 100,000 with physical disabilities is probably decreasing, as fewer people acquire disabilities and those that did decades ago pass away. Is this true? Are there countervailing trends I'm missing out here?

askscience,"Due to both an RF circuit design class and personal interest, I've been reading up on radios and antenna design and came across a fact that I think illustrates some error in my visualization of how EM waves propagate. In a microwave appliance, there is a metal mesh behind the front window that blocks microwaves from escaping. The explanation for this is that the holes in this mesh are small enough in relation to the wavelength of the microwave such that there is not enough space for them to pass through. In TEM mode like this would be in free air both amplitude components of the wave are perpendicular to the direction of propagation, however, they are measures of field strength so should be unrelated to matters of distance like hole size. But wavelength is a measure of distance along the axis of propagation, so how does changing the size of a hole in a mesh prevent a discrete ray from travelling through it normal to the plane of the hole?

askscience,"I'm finishing up ""Qbism"" by Hans Christian von Baeyer and ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene.

I can't find much online about the relationship, if there is one. I have a feeling that I may be misunderstanding guage symmetry/invariance so I'll give my best understanding of both. Please correct me on anything that's off!

One concept of entropy would be the number of ""microstates"" (molecular/atomic structures) that could create a given ""macrostate"" (observable system). A glass of water has high entropy because the H2O molecules could be organized any-which way and you'd still have the same glass of water. 

My understanding of guage symmetry (same as invariance?) its that a field or variable is said to have this property if fiddling with it doesn't change the measurable result.

In [another medrxiv abstract](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140731v1) Brazillian researches report detecting COVID in two sewage samples in Santa Catalina/Florianopolis as early as November 2019.

askscience,"Learning how Diesel-Electric locomotives work has lead me to wonder why we don't see a similar principal in larger commercial automobiles? On the surface it looks like it would be especially effective with the more modern systems locomotives use that use a main alternator to produce AC power that is converted to DC, then reconfigured to 3-phase AC to power individual motors that drive each wheel. If per-say a tractor trailer had a diesel engine that powered a large alternator that then drove six individual AC motors on each of the wheels, it would have much more low-end torque than a standard transmission, and be able to cruise at speed a lot more easily.

askscience,"So I get that de Broglie came up with the idea of λ = h/p

One thing I can't get into my mind is how does this differ from the regular formula  λ = v/f?

Obviously the formulas differ since the first one relates momentum and the wavelength. But if I had a ball, and were asked to measure the wavelength (which it does have since everything behaves like a wave and a particle), will I get the same result if I used either?

I tried solving this for photons (measuring their wavelength), and I got 2 totally different answers. I tried to measure the wavelength of a ball by using both too, but since h is so small, I get 2 totally different answers.

We're currently in a cold stretch - roughly 0°F, swinging a little above during the day and a little below at night. Every day, the sun hits these ice crystals on our window and melts them into round water droplets, but it's too cold for them to evaporate. So every night, they refreeze in these sort of star patterns.

Why do they change shape as they freeze, rather than freeze as droplets? I've been thinking about it myself - I assume they start freezing on the outer surface, and water of course expands as it freezes. I'm tempted to think that the glass might be slightly warm under the droplet since it's close to the house, but this phenomenon happens on a screen as well, and in that case both sides are exposed to the cold air.

askscience,"I saw something about Hawking Radiation and it's effects on black holes. It describes a scenario by which black holes can decrease in mass by the spontaneous formation of pairs of particles; one of these particle has mass and the other has negative mass. Usually these particles annihilate each other shortly after their formation but when this event occurs near the event horizon of a black hole it is possible for the particle with mass to escape and be observed as radiation, and the negative mass (anti-mass?) particle can ""fall"" in to the black hole and decrement the black hole's mass.


My question. If events beyond the event horizon can not be said to ever actually occur in the timeline of an outside observer, then how can any of this activity ever take place? And how could we observe a black hole losing mass by some mechanism taking place beyond the event horizon?


Perhaps I'm misunderstanding this and this action is actually taking place ""outside"" the black hole in the mass that I assume we would see smeared around the cusp of the event horizon (matter that has been ""captured"" by the black hole after it's formation). But if that is the case, is it true that all of a black hole's mass actually resides in some sort of sphere just outside the event horizon? That doesn't sound correct either.

This instability can be triggered by turbulence in the surrounding air or by local variation in air temperature or density, which may itself be the result of the stratification of the atmosphere.

After skimming through a wikipedia article on vortices (the 'Crow Instability' one is a stub), I gathered that 'rings' or vortices are formed when a fast moving fluid meets resistance against a slower moving one, so that the friction in the interface between the two creates the vortex.

Another factor is that during exhalation, mouth breathing is completely ineffective in retaining moisture.

You will find that the moisture left on the glass following nasal exhalation is far less than the moisture left from exhaling through the mouth.

askscience,"First,  sorry I missed the AMA (UK based so time zone issues) hopefully someone can comment. My question: We have all heard the quoted 95% for e.g Pfizer and 70% effective for Oxford vaccines.  But it looked to me like the underlying study outputs and processes make those numbers completely incomparable. For example,  Pfizer only tested to confirm  (by PCR)  symptomatic patients,  whilst Oxford tested (at least in the UK cohort) weekly regardless of symptoms,  and as a result picked up a huge number of asymptomatic infections (almost half of the UK infections seen in the study) and included those in calculating its 70% figure.  Surely this means that on a comparable basis the Pfizer efficacy would be much lower? How can we compare them?

EDIT: a number of commenters have pointed out that my question was in fact based on a misunderstanding (I think based on the UK study report alone and not the pooled data article),  and that the Oxford efficacy calculation  appears to have only looked at the symptomatic cases so they are actually more comparable than I had realised. 

Thanks to those commenters.

The quote from the Lancet article in the results section is that:
""The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against NAAT-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, defined as a NAAT-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever ≥37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia).""",Are the vaccine efficacies for COVID vaccines able to be directly compared?,stickytreefrog

Ever since then I've had this question, that if they infect the body in a way that causes sickness, Is it possible that they also change whatever may be passed onto children of those that survived it? Further I also wonder whether those changes go beyond just immune respones and actually cause changes that reach farther. Like the expression of certain genes etc. 

So really what I'm wondering is, if there is any research into this idea, or if it even makes any sense? I have heard of research using viruses to cure certain ailments like cancer, but I'm talking about changes that, only after generations down the line are apparent.

askscience,"Every simple explanation I've ever heard about how antibodies work, describes an example where the virus is ""floating around in fluid"" like either blood or some other kind of fluid, and the antibodies float around too and ""stick"" to the antigens and neutralize the virus.

But from my understanding, SARS-CoV-2 attack vector is the upper respiratory system, where it enters our body from floating droplets in our airways through the nose and mouth.  The droplets then settle on the tissue inside of our airways and the infection begins there.  Is my visualization of how that works correct?

If such is the case, the virus is initially hitting ""exterior"" cells, because it is touching the cells that line your airway, so they are hitting a ""wall"" of cells in your nose and throat and beyond that wall is just a cavity filled with air.

So how do the antibodies neutralize the virus in this situation?  If the virus is not ""inside"" our body floating around in our blood stream.

It says:  

&gt;Based on communication principles, the maximum signal bandwidth in wireless communication is about 5% of the carrier frequency. Therefore, the higher the carrier frequency, the greater the signal bandwidth. That’s why, among the millimeter-wave frequencies, 28 GHz and 60 GHz are the most promising frequencies for 5G. The 28 GHz band can provide an available spectrum bandwidth of up to 1 GHz, while each channel in the 60 GHz band can provide an available signal bandwidth of 2 GHz (a total available spectrum of 9 GHz divided between four channels).

I suspect that the faster motion of fast-twitch muscle fibers is simply due to their ability to produce greater force.

askscience,"Current COVID vaccines are not 100% efficacious—not claiming any vaccine ought to. While Pfizer/BionTech and Moderna near it with, respectively, 95% and 94.1% efficacy, other vaccines such as Astrazeneca's and JNJ get a lower efficacy, respectively, of 60-70% and 66%.

The efficacy of all vaccines could be lower to COVID variants (UK variant, South Africa variant, Brazil variant), for instance Novavax which has 89% as overall efficacy, but downs to 49.4% to South African variant.

The vaccines though have proved nonetheless to reduce the severity of disease, such as no vaccinated volunteer being hospitalized from COVID in Moderna's and AZ's Phase 3 trials (which may mean 100% efficacy against hospitalization).

The question is, if you're in the *unlucky* percentage, what is expected to happen in your body if you turn positive some way to Sars-cov2? People normally affected from COVID can have mild or none symptoms to moderate/severe conditions such as pneumonia, organ's damage, low O2, blood clots, or death. Can you still develop pneumonia even if your immunity is at its best? Can you become a Covid long hauler? 

The impact of reducing (or eliminating) hospitalizations by the vaccines is reassuring, but more would be (for me and many other people, I suppose) knowing more about it.

If the above is correct, does that mean that the tristimulus values of spectral green and cyan+yellow are the same, like in the case of yellow and green+red?

Apologies if this is a dumb question. I think my confusion comes in part from trying to figure how additive and subtractive color models fit in the real world. Would it be accurate to say that subtractive color is a part of physical reality, while additive color exists only as a part of human perception?

Bonus question: I understand that in reality a blue object does reflect other wavelengths besides ""blue"" ones, albeit at a lower intensity. But are there chemicals or chemical structures that manage to exclusively reflect an incredibly narrow range of wavelengths (say, 500-505nm), without reflecting any other wavelengths at any degree of intensity?

askscience,"It's all over solid state text books that the velocity of electrons in a metal (assume no applied field) is something like root(kT/m) (I don't care about the 2's and/or 3's that I'm missing). This perspective makes sense because it's sort of the amount of energy an electron might get from the thermal bath it's sitting in.

But also, from QM, if we keep adding fermions (electrons in this case) to the metal, they'll occupy higher and higher energy states. Even at T = 0, the electrons will have nonzero energy, in particular, electrons at the top will be at the Fermi energy. In this case, the thermal velocity would be zero, but the Fermi velocity can get up near a percent of the speed of light (graphene for example). Clearly this is a huge discrepancy.

So, why do we say electron speed is governed by kT instead of the Fermi level?

The US, the UK and Israel have all had very dramatic reductions in the number of lab confirmed cases recently.  The US and the UK in particular have seen their numbers decline very steadily since about January 10, and that would suggest that the number of infections started to drop for both of them by about January 1 (given the typical lag between infections and when they turn up in lab confirmed results).

Israel's drop in numbers has been shorter, only about a week, but it has been very dramatic. Such sharp drops are usually due to results being reported late, but in this case the sharp decline has been apparent for over a week now - it's real. Israel has reportedly given the first does of the Pfizer vaccine to at least 37% of their population and their high vaccination rate is probably what is causing this sharp reduction for them.

The UK has been in a fairly strict lockdown for weeks now, and that is the most likely explanation for their rapid and steady drop in lab confirmed numbers.

But the US has seen a drop in daily lab confirmed numbers very similar to the UK's.  For when the drop started, it's steepness and for how long it's been going on. 

I can't find any reason for why the US's numbers are dropping so quickly. They're vaccination rate isn't that high.  They haven't implemented any new strict lockdowns (a football game I listened to for a few minutes last night mentioned that there were only 17,000 fans there but that it was still nearly as loud as when it's at it's 70,000 capacity - that is not a lockdown). 

What happened around January 1 that could explain the USA's rapid and sustained decline in daily lab confirmed cases?

askscience,"When I say ""COVID-19 location-tracking apps,"" I am referring to any app that tracks the location history of your phone alongside other phones with that app installed (e.g. CA Notify). These apps then allow you to submit positive test results, so that everyone who you interacted with prior can be notified that they might have COVID-19 and should quarantine. This is my general understanding of what the purpose of these apps are.

I just tested negative for COVID-19, but CA Notify will only allow me to submit data if the results are positive. This seems inefficient... Why not gather more data? Why gratuitously decide to not collect info?

I understand why CA Notify might not want negative test results - they don't really mean anything to the people who previously interacted with, considering the people who you previously interacted with also interacted with dozens of other people during that time and could still test positive even though you tested negative...

But then again, many people have these apps, and many people carry their phones. Knowing that 50% of the people you interacted with tested negative is much better than knowing that 24% of the people you interacted with tested negative. The more you know how much you are NOT interacting with the virus, the more you can understand about who is infection, right? I just feel like more data makes data easier to look at, but maybe I'm wrong.

A negative result is more information than nothing. I don't understand why we are not tracking this and using some AI and machine learning or something. I'm sure we could find ways to give weight to who is MORE likely to have COVID-19 than others. This doesn't seem hard to add to an app (imo)...

In my layman's understanding, it seems that if an organism has a mutation that is useful for sex (like haploid cells or a sexual mechanism, some way to transfer DNA), but then can't find another organism with a complimentary sex mutation in reasonable proximity before it dies, it won't reproduce that useful mutation and the mutation ends there.

Our planet is also unique among others, insofar as it has liquid water, which most planets don't.

But we would expect these properties to be present in an environment that can harbor life, so it's not tremendously interesting that they're present.  Once you ignore the conditions necessary for life, there isn't anything obvious that remains that makes the space we occupy particularly out-of-the-ordinary.  We seem to live with some run-of-the-mill neighboring planets, orbiting a main sequence star that sits in a relatively quiet part of a galaxy that is one of many Sb shaped galaxies in the observable universe.

There are astronomical bodies that just so happen to have some cool properties that wouldn't appear to affect the capacity for life.  Some planets have nonspherical moons, or moons with a particularly elliptical orbit, or live in a star system with an unusually large number of planets.  Some star systems live inside nebulae.  Some are on the very outskirts of their galaxy.  Some galaxies are irregularly shaped, and some live in intergalactic voids.  Our planet *could* have had any of these properties and life would still be possible (though it may look different).  But it doesn't.

But I'm not convinced that there aren't any interesting properties about where we are that aren't tied to life existing here in the universe.  Is there anything about our planet, our star system, our local group, our galaxy, or our galactic cluster that is extraordinary merely by coincidence?",Is there anything extraordinary about our location in the universe that isn't tied to the fact that life is possible here?,ArbitraryRenaissance

Another way to look at the same problem is if you were to accelerate a muon in a box and have it decay before exiting you could catch the electron and still have a net momentum gain equivalent to nearly 106 times the electrons mass.

(a 1/16"" distance equates to a 1/8"" round trip, and a 900Ghz clock will have a 1/8"" round trip per tick, but your precision is half your sampling speed, so you need at least double that, right? so 1800Ghz)

askscience,"For pentane vs pentanol, for example, this is the complete combustion (balanced to have equal number of moles of pentanol and pentane):

Pentanol: 2 C2H11OH (l) +15 O2 (g) → 10 CO2 (g)+ 12 H2O (g)+ energy

Pentane: 2 C5H12 (l) + 16 O2 (g)→ 10 CO2 (g)+ 12 H2O (g)+ energy

(Formula for enthalpy of combustion: bonds broken - bonds formed) (I think)

So since the products are the same (bond formed), then the change is at the bonds broken. From my understanding, pentane (higher enthalpy of combustion) should have less energy ""wasted"" in breaking bonds, as pentane's reactants should have weaker (or less) bonds.

However pentane's combustion has one extra O2 bond, so does that mean that pentanol's bonds are so much stronger (because of the OH) than pentane's to the point where even with the extra O2 molecule it takes more energy to break the bonds of pentanol's combustion rather than the bonds of pentanol's reaction?

I know that there are also incomplete combustions, but my teacher told me that just by looking at the complete combustion I should see why pentane has a higher enthalpy.

The paper is over 100 pages long, and I will admit that I simply do not have the time to read through each source and determine whether it is represented accurately in Schumm's paper.   


However, when I looked into Schumm's prior work, it seems that he has a history of misrepresenting research on gay parenting ([http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2010/10/17/27400](http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2010/10/17/27400)).

AskSocialScience,"Recently a friend sent me an [Article](http://womanmeanssomething.com/transition-as-treatment-the-best-studies-show-the-worst-outcomes/) after I asked them about their opinion on transgender issues. Needless to say, it concerned me. The article seems to imply that most studies that support transitioning and clinical treatment for transgender people take place over short periods of time, have high rates of people not following up, and that those that go for longer and have more follow-up speak against the effectiveness of the treatment. They claim that the results show a [Honeymoon period](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19040622/) for transgender people, and cite [Nobili 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11154-018-9459-y) that lists only 2 of 29 studies as high quality.

The most important studies they detail are as follows.

**Low Quality Studies**

[Ruppin &amp; Pfafflin 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690443): This is named as an example of a study that loses several people to follow-up.

[Lindqvist 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00238-016-1252-0): In addition to low follow-up, they claim that SF-36 data indicates that the author's explanations for the drop-off in physical and mental components as being applicable to the general population are wrong.

**High Quality Studies**

[Asscheman 2011 (Netherlands)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266549): “total mortality was 51% higher than in the general population, mainly from increased mortality rates due to suicide, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cardiovascular disease, drug abuse, and unknown cause.”

[Dhejne 2011 (Sweden)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885): They acknowledge the drop-off in suicide in the 1989-2003 cohort, but dismiss this on the basis of other studies that speak to the contrary. 

[Rauchfleish 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9789272) [Lindemalm 1986](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542412) and  [Simonsen 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479779): All are listed despite their acknowledged low sample size.

[Adams 2017](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/trgh.2016.0036): “It seems counterintuitive, on the other hand, that suicide attempts are lower before transition (ideation 36.1%; attempt 13.1%) than over most other periods (past year attempts being the exception).”

 [Jellestad 2018 (Switzerland)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/8684625/): ""found not only a lower mental quality of life for the surgically-transitioned group than the general population, but that neither hormone treatment nor surgery predicted positive quality of life.""

[Auer 2013 (Germany)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078469): ""investigated a hormone treated clinical group, and in comparison with a control group found “significantly higher mean scores in all psychopathology subscales”, no matter which sex was used as comparison. ""

All this being said, how do their claims stack up? I'm aware that there are several studies exist that support the efficacy of transition, and the website I was sent appears to be run by someone with an agenda who published a derided study on target's bathroom policy.

AskSocialScience,"[I recently came across a post claiming that the famous Swedish Study demonstrated a ""male pattern of criminality.""](https://girlsfrommars.tumblr.com/post/181924379541/swedish-study-debunking-the-debunk)

Despite the study's author saying in [an interview](https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) that their study does not demonstrate such a thing, this post claims ""she’s probably sick of being harassed by trans activists and is probably willing to say anything to get them off her back."" Considering that this can only generously be called speculation, I feel that there is some missing nuance here. Their argument is as follows

&gt;they only measured all crime and they didn’t drill down on violent crime as they did for the longer group, and even for the “any crime” category it literally stayed the same. Males are much much MUCH more likely to commit crimes than females are, so in order to claim that trans males are no more likely to commit crimes than females the hazard ratio would have to drop by quite a bit now wouldn’t it? The researchers themselves concluded that “ Transsexual individuals were at increased risk of being convicted for any crime or violent crime after sex reassignment ([Table 2](https://archive.vn/o/sXztJ/https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885%23pone-0016885-t002)).”  
“This means that for the 1989 to 2003 group, we did not find a male pattern of criminality.”This phrasing is very deliberate. She does not say “the MtFs”, she says “the group” or “the cohort”, which includes both the MtFs and the FtMs. So Dhejne’s quote is correct, meaning that “trans people as a group did not show male pattern of criminality”. **It does not say that \[trans women\] did not show male pattern of criminality**(they do).The statistics divided by time period are not sorted by sex, which further obfuscates the results with respect to MtFs crime pattern.”

AskSocialScience,"I don't feel like I have a hard time understanding any of [Geert Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions theory](https://geerthofstede.com), except for this specific dimension. It was originally called Masculinity, or the gamut of masculinity—femininity. Hofstede and his followers, though, took pains to warn readers that this variable was not a reliable indicator of women's freedom relative to men's in that culture. From what I can gather, there is some correlation to that culture's socially acceptable gender roles, but it's not simple or direct. Some Hofstedians have attempted to rename this variable to ease confusion. I've seen ""quantity-of-life cultures vs. quality-of-life cultures"" and ""task-oriented vs. people-oriented"" suggested.

That helps a bit, but a question I have is, how is MAS an independent variable? I haven't done the math to back this up and am mediocre at statistics, but I hypothesize that high MAS is actually just a product of moderate-to-high individualism (INV), moderate-to-high power distance (PDI), and moderate to high indulgence (IND). Find me a culture that's high on all these but low on MAS, and I'll eat my crow-feathered hat.

I'll take a stab at *my* sense of what MAS means in layman's terms. Please attack it; I'd like to learn something:
In cultures that score high on MAS, it is incumbent upon all males, and optional for females, to cultivate a mindset and life attitude befitting a capable hunter or warrior. There are fewer social limits on the strategic use of harm to achieve one's aims. People aim to objectively outrank each other on hard metrics, rather than aiming to subjectively feel better as a primary end. Inequality is to be expected, as a natural product of competition, which itself is natural and good. It's a dog-eat-dog world, and who has more power than whom is the only real, objective measure of who has played the game of life better, on the level of one's social circle or the whole world just the same.
In low MAS cultures, by contrast, subjective wellbeing — being at peace with oneself and at peace with the world around oneself — is the primary goal, rather than a hoped-for secondary outcome of more objective, fact-based societal metrics. In low MAS cultures, it is incumbent upon all people, male and female, to be highly in tune with their own needs, and the needs of those around them, and be shrewd about when and what to contribute toward the greater good.

AskSocialScience,"Hello!

First, to define *plural people*, is heard people who live in a *system* of several *alters*, occupying the same physical body.   
Clinically, that can refer to Dissociative Identity Disorder, or to other dissociative troubles.   
Non-clinically, it may refer to anyone who sees themselves having multiple *alters*/*""personalities""/headmates*, for a large amount of reasons, for example culture, religion (see *tulpamancy*), or even just 'it feels natural' (see *paromancy*).

Most of the studies I can find go very deeply into the clinical side, reasons DID exists and interactions with other troubles (eg ASD, schizophrenia, ...), but don't really aboard the simplest side of 'everyday life', how an individual living as a system is impacted during social life (work, relationships, etc etc).  
An evident impact would be the gender of such an individual, which might be the gender of the *main alter*, or a combination of everything, or something else. I already couldn't find any sort of study simply talking of the gender of these plural individuals (*this wording sounds odd, right?*).

My question mainly regards:   
\- What are studies that have been made regarding non-clinical plural people? What sort of tools have people used to observe this situation?  
\- Are there studies that have been conducted specifically on transgender and/or non-binary plural individuals, clinically or not?

&gt;The club was faced with a difficult decision. Its members are independent people. Each is entitled to make up his own mind. If the three men decided to go on tour in South Africa after the end of the season here, the club would not be affected. The club therefore did send the anti-apartheid case to the Leicestershire Rugby Union and did ensure that each of the three players was given a copy of the anti-apartheid memorandum. But the club did not comply with the council request to put pressure on the players not to go to South Africa. This did not mean that the club was supporting apartheid because there is **a body of opinion opposed to apartheid which believes (contrary to the Gleneagles agreement) that sporting links will help to reduce apartheid in sport**.

&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The 1984 Rugby Tour of South Africa was organised by the
Rugby Football Union which invited individuals, including three
members of the club to join the tour. There were two views
about the tour amongst the opponents of apartheid. The view
taken by the council, a view which I share, was that the tour
would endorse the racist policies of the South African Government.
The opposite view was expressed by Mr. Dodge, who was one of
the three members of the club who participated in the tour and
who gave sworn evidence in these proceedings as follows:

&gt;&gt;""I personally deplore apartheid as being morally wrong. It is
nevertheless **my genuine belief that maintaining sporting
links with South Africa does help break down the evil social
barriers of apartheid**, a personal belief which has been
strengthened by observing in 1984 the improvement since
1980.""    

&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **The council agree that this belief was sincerely held not
only by Mr. Dodge but by other opponents of apartheid.** The
Government had subscribed to the Gleneagles agreement but did
not take steps to ban the tour, leaving the decision to each
individual invited to take part. The club does not practice racial
discrimination, does not support apartheid, has not been guilty of
any infringement of the Race Relations Act 1976, did not support
the decision of the three members to join the tour and sought to
discourage them from joining the tour by sending them copies of
the reasoned memorandum published by the opponents of the tour.
The council does not contend that the club should have threatened
or punished the three club members who participated in the tour
or that the club could properly have done so. Nevertheless, the
club has been punished by the council according Mr. Soulsby for

We're hoping to ""build a movement"" of young people across the country who are interested in cross-party civil dialogue. While it's somewhat easy to find folks in any college who are interested in these tough discussions, it's quite difficult to keep them all informed and all discussing the best ways to engage folks who are actually there to argue.

It turns out, there's a science (very young and constantly developing science)  to engaging with others who don't share your opinion. As we continue to conduct research in this field and continue to learn from other folks trying it out, we need a way to share best practices, resources, etc. We also need a way to let others share their challenges, their successes, and so on.

It occurs to me that many professionals (doctors, scientists, etc.) might already be working in online communities they can share ideas, discuss ideas, perhaps even argue about ideas, but ultimately use as a resource to improve their work. I'm especially interested in how you connect with very niche concepts- for example, ""Race and Privilege"" is fairly well-trodden and likely easy to seek out new ideas. ""Race and Privilege in McDonald's playgrounds,"" however is much less common and, thus, anyone concerned with just that, must have a way to connect to the other few people studying it?

This [2013 Pew poll](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) about world Muslim opinion of religion, politics and society offers an insight into the modern Islamic world. First of all: Do the poll's methodology, presentation and conclusion generally appear sound to you?

According to that poll, adopting sharia enjoys a great deal of popularity among Muslims outside of Europe and Central Asia, especially in the Middle East and South Asia where support is almost universal — though most agree it should only apply to Muslims. Still, a significant amount of Muslims supports the death penalty for apostasy (i.e. conversion from Islam) especially in Malaysia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine among countries polled.

And yet... When Muslims were asked if they valued religious freedom and the ability of non-Muslims to practice openly, 76% was the *lowest* recorded approval rate — with most over 90%. Moreover, when Muslims were asked if they thought targeting civilians was sometimes justified, 40% was the *highest* recorded approval rate — with most well below 30%. That's less than the \~55% approval rate recorded among Americans in a [2010 Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx).

AskSocialScience," I dont know if this question goes here, but here it goes.

The  subject is that recently I've been thinking about this question, and I  got to some positive points and some negatives. So I would like to know  what other people think about it.

Also, this is about all porn: staged, amateur, homemade, hentai, etc. It is all related through websites, ads and interests after all.

The positives:

Porn  media help to normalize sexuality, wich is a toxic taboo in our  society, because can, and do, make people feel bad, ashame, etc, about  something that is natural and normal. Only this can be its own topic so  I'm letting it there.

Studies have  shown that porn consumition decreases sexual assaults. I havent seem  much of this matter, but I've seen this affimation in several pages. If I  recall correctly It has to do with sexual impulses being released  through porn instead of the real thing.

The negatives:

Porn  is not something that isn't fully regulated, as almost everything on  the internet, but with porn things get a little more intense. It can be  cases of people dragged to the world of porn filming, against their  will, totally or partially.

It can  even be seen as a form of the problem of prostitution, where people get  in a situation where they cant get out, and find themselves trapped and  you could say even enslaved.

Also there is the case of pornographic content of people upload against their will.

All of this is very aggravated by how sex is something very intimate in our society

My conclusions:

Maybe  the consumition of porn would help destroy the taboo. This could help  to make it more a regulated thing, a less obscure part of the internet.  It could also help to  diminish the type of enslavery I talked about,  and also, it would be less of an intimate thing, wich would make all  kind of sexual aggresion less painful (I'm talking about what I already  said but also all kinds of it).

In  the other hand just not consuming that type of content would simply  diminish the demand, and so, the problems that comes with it, but maybe  the more obscure the matter becomes the worst.

So  here I am, I think this is a real problem for some people and I would  like do the right thing, even if it just helps a little.",Is consuming pornography good or bad for society?,IgneuxX

\-The black-white income disparity has widened.

This culture is not unique about this language learning industry; instead, there are multiple industries personal training, personal development, dating, and many other industries.

**Example 1(Marketing Culture)**: 

**1-Coach with basic knowledge of a language** will go out to a neighborhood where there are lots of people who speak that foreign language. 

2-**The Coach will film himself talking to the foreign people.** The unfamiliar people are either paid actors or willing participants. The Coach shock the people with his ""scripted"" speech.

3-**The Coach will upload his video to a social media platform with strong buzzwords**, 'shocking! Average guy speaks perfect X foreign language.""

4- The naive people on the comments will sign up for lessons or buy the 'digital course.""

**5-Most of the material turns out to be basic language training** for beginners. Half the people will not complain and accept whatever the coach tells them, sign up for more lessons or buy more courses. 

**6-The another half will complain and write negative reviews**. The Coach will say, ""They are haters,"" or ""They are jealous of his success,"" or ""they didn't put in the work.""Most of the native audience will defend the Coach and justify his action. Very few will take ""legal action.""

**7-It seems like the government doesn't care and doesn't get involved in these transactions.** 

**Example 2**:

1-**Language Coach**: I promise you I can get you to learn French in 30 days, or otherwise you'll get your money back.

2-**Student**: Sure, I'll give it. Try! Although academics say, that language learning might take much longer.

3-**Language Coach**: Don't listen to academics; they don't know what they are talking about. I have this new method that I've devised. 

**4-Student signs up for lessons:** they end up being subpar or the coach makes his ""intern"" teach the lesson. 

**5- The student asks for a refund, yet he is not granted one**. Instead, the coach doesn't bother and won't answer the calls.

6- Most students give up on the refund on their own. Simultaneously, the minority who doesn't is 'shamed"" by their friends and family were ""fools"" for believing the coach. Eventually, the minority also lets it go after writing a bad review.

For example, people can argue that the lower divorce rate in Italy, Poland, Ireland, Latinamerica is caused by the faith of Catholicism, and the higher divorce rate in Czechia compared with the former is caused by a higher degree of secularization.

However, how should I understand why the divorce rate of Italy is lower than that of Spain? In addition, If I compare between different Orthodox countries, why is the divorce rate in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine much higher than in Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Georgia?

I am wondering if there anyone can point me towards some research on the effects of exposure to parental sexual expressiveness on younger children/adolescents.

Would also take literature where the sexuality is more overt, such as bringing sexual partners into the home, or participating in sex work, around children/adolescents.

I mean to distnguish between expressions of care and affection between parents, versus forms of sexual expression directed toward other people who the child does not know (online viewers, non-committal sexual partners, etc.)

AskSocialScience,"Hi all

I live in South Africa, and with the zombie apocalypse, our government shut down the sale of alcohol as soon as COVID peaks here every time. The reason they provide is that South Africans have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and that we overload our public health system with alcohol related injuries which leaves little space for people suffering from COVID.

My argument (Without any evidence, which is why I’m here.)  is that South African have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol as a result of the old laws that’s been around since we got independence from England in the 30s.

Before the 30s South Africa was an English colony and as a result we have all these rules around alcohol sale times (we also have super constrictive laws about radio/tv frequency and in other industries ) which has been around since England made them looong ago.

I’ve had the privilege to travel throughout Asia, and the one thing that becomes very apparent to a South African was that you can buy alcohol at any 7Eleven at any time of the day and night. If there are people there who has a unhealthy relationship with alcohol they were few and far between and they didn't seem to have the same issues we have.

The second part of my argument puzzle is the way corporate companies treat their employees. This is something I have 1st hand experience in. Corporate companies tend to treat their employees like children. E.g. They will create teams, and then the team will have to come up with a name, and then compete with other teams. They will also hand out treats if you ""won” something, etc. It’s hard to explain, but if you’ve worked in a corporate you probably know what I’m talking about. You will also know that what this does is take all responsibility away from the employee, as they go straight into playground mode when they get treated like this for long enough.

So, to come back to my argument. I believe that the South African government is (maybe) unintentionally doing the same thing for years and years by not revising these laws. They treat South Africans as children, taking away their responsibility, to a degree, and then limiting their access to something they want. This causes, when the restrictions are lifted, that people go crazy when they access alcohol again which then bumps the hospital admissions and then causes a confirmation bias on the side of the government.

I’m 41 now and as long as I can remember alcohol laws have been this strict here. Without any COVID or national emergency, we can’t buy alcohol at a bottle store after 6 or 8pm (depends on how much money the liquor store was willing to fork out for a liquor license.) On Weekends this is earlier as well, with some liquor stores being closed on Sundays (also liquor license).

I’m sure a bunch of these UK laws are in place because it's a way for them to tax people who already pay tax, but at some point this will need to be resolved, so that we can move forward as adults and not children who're grounded.

**Observations**

**Some Latin American societies**: It seems people don't read and get their education from television. The people who read tend to be professors and the professors will publish their books mostly for other professors to read. It doesn't seem like a widespread practice that young people could publish a novel or book and get attention. 

**United States**: It's a vast country, almost like its own continent. The professors' case is similar in that maybe an associate professor will ""stick their neck out' and write their book, mostly for other professors to read it. To publish a political book seems like you need to have substantial evidence, and it looks like only Ph.D. grads will publish a book for a specialized journal at the end of their Ph.D. 

Given how huge the country is, even if a young person would publish their political book or novel, they would mostly be relegated to a niche. Maybe they'll have fans within that niche but might be unknown to the public at large. 

What I've seen is that the political class seems to have more connections with the business world as  opposed to the intellectual or academic world. Hence, you often don't see politicians talking about an abstract theory but rather trying to appeal to the masses.

**Argentina**(From what I've heard, France might have a similar culture) It seems that three things happen (I don't think this is unique to Argentinian society, but its the example I'm most familiar with);

1-There's a large number of people reading and publishing. This author Berliac said he decided to publish his book since everyone around him was publishing as well.

2-You, don't need to have a Ph.D. or be an associate professor for people to listen to what you have to say. This intellectual, Agustin Lange, was an undergraduate student when he published his political theory book, and people listen to him and even became popular.

3- What these public intellectuals read/say has more weight. Since there appears to be more of a connection between the political class and the intellectual class.

AskSocialScience,"Living in America it's very common to dismiss the centuries long captivity and racism that has plagued African Americans.

European Americans and white Europeans that dismiss African American racism usually place the blame on African Americans for experiencing racism. 

Often by suggesting that they just see race everywhere, they shouldn't be bothered because everyone is equal, etc

Africans also dismiss a lot of African American racism and different nationalities of Africa can be seen placing negative stereotypes of black people on African Americans.

As well as black British people often siding against African Americans when it comes to topics regarding how to confront modern day racism.

Many Hispanic and Latin American nations also not only dismiss the ability to be both black and hispanic/latino but actively participate in racism against them.

East Asian and South Asian people have also been seen in large to side against African Americans when regarding racial issues.

Despite their being a multitude of black Jewish people, white passing Jewish people specifically in America participated in racism against us especially after their own tragedies with racism.

Italian and Irish people are still European American yet their racism is treated with more sympathy and understanding than African American racism.

African Americans speaking out against racism is at times met with ""black people can be racist too.""

African Americans speaking out against slavery, segregation, and modern day racism are constantly berated with discussions of Irish slavery or italian american racism.

Is it caused by the media, education system, what is the reason for one group to be so hated and constantly criticized for speaking out against their own oppression?

AskSocialScience,"Professor Ibram X. Kendi wrote an influential book called *How to be an Antiracist*, among other works.  In his [own words](https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/june/ibram-x-kendi-definition-of-antiracist.html):

&gt;There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy… If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist.  

He defines racial inequity and equity: 
&gt; Racial inequity is when two or more racial groups are not standing on approximately equal footing. Here’s an example of racial inequity: 71 percent of White families lived in owner-occupied homes in 2014, compared to 45 percent of Latinx families and 41 percent of Black families. Racial equity is when two or more racial groups are standing on a relatively equal footing. An example of racial equity would be if there were relatively equitable percentages of all three racial groups living in owner-occupied homes in the forties, seventies, or, better, nineties.

He believes that ""...the only solution to racist discrimination is anti-racist discrimination"" and his fundamental definitions of racism and antiracism are: 

&gt;Racism is a powerful collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity and are substantiated by racist ideas. Antiracism is a powerful collection of antiracist policies that lead to racial equity and are substantiated by antiracist ideas.

1.  Is he correct in his assertion that racist policies made by racist policymakers lead to the perpetutation of racist ideas?

2.  Is his claim that every disparity between non-white and white populations a result of racist policies (I.e. prejudice and discrimination) correct? 

3.  Whether or not the above claim is true, is his proposed solution (i.e. anti-racist discrimination) the only solution to inequities between racial groups?

He just speaks of to whom should things such as property and education belong to, but never about if force or not are used to accomplish it. It's very confusing.

2. A lot of apps make things convenient and are easy to use themselves due to good UX design (e.g. iPads, Websites, etc). When was the last time you needed to read an instruction manual to figure out how to operate something?
3. Government institutions (at least in Canada, and I theorize in North America as a whole) have not been able to harness technology effectively to make civic engagement convenient. By civic engagement I mean contacting your local representative, voting, taxes, dealing with legal institutions, and most government services (this varies from country to country so I kept it vague).
4. I think people have been conditioned to expect a certain standard of convenience and democratic institutions have not been able to provide that convenience (neither have authoritarian governments, but there is much less expectation of citizenship participation there). To me this has led to lower voter turnout and lower engagement with government representatives.

AskSocialScience,"Hi all,

Sorry if this is a weird or dumb question. But I am wondering why sex is so taboo, yet as soon as a woman gets pregnant, it is common for her to take pictures of her pregnant belly and show it off on social media. Being pregnant and having a baby is considered ""beautiful"" and a ""miracle,"" yet we do not have the same positive emotions when we imagine that same couple engaging in the sexual act that created the baby. In fact, we cannot even talk about them having sex without the conversation becoming awkward or making people feel uncomfortable or ""gross."" Ejaculation, semen, orgasms, etc. cannot be talked about, yet without these things, the ""miracle"" of pregnancy would not exist. 

To me, it just doesn't make sense that pregnancy can be considered ""beautiful"" and you can show off your pregnant belly to the whole world, yet the sexual act itself is so taboo that you can hardly talk about it with anyone without the conversation becoming weird or awkward.

AskSocialScience,"I was unsure of where to post this.

The reason I ask is quite simple. Whenever a discussion of communism comes up, people are quick to chime in that communism has killed x number of people, and I believe this argument is always put forward in bad faith.

Not because it is disingenuous or impractical to be concerned about such things, and not even because it is often historically inaccurate to a certain degree - but rather because this point is never given in the context that capitalism also, as a point of fact, has led to the unjust death of millions.

I think that any system of governance will invariably be unable to save everyone, so it is not out of idleness that we speculate on these matters - we have to be scientifically minded, with the goal of understanding how to better the lives of everyone.

But the question of how many people die due to capitalism is so difficult because of the nature of the free market. If you have so many different agents, corporating their desires and exerting their forces of political and financial power within markets --- this sort of bombastic dynamism of capital, then it becomes very difficult to follow causal nodes, and attribute any blame in a scientific manner.

There is a sort of inherent obscurantism behind the signaling economic agents under a capitalist framework. i.e., our ability to discern directly which market forces are causing poverty, imperial violence, genocide, and civil unrest --- is obstructed by how noisy/dynamic capital is.

Whereas with communism, and some related notions of 'planned' economies, faults in the distribution of labour and resources is much easier to delineate. The relations of production are not so various and dynamic, and in spirit are only meant to work within the one, primary relation - the people/the workers owning the means of production.

So while I think criticisms of communism are valid, they must be willing to bring those same criticisms and notions of virtue to bear upon capital, which they rarely ever do - which is why I think it is put forward in bad faith.

AskSocialScience,"Title correction: ""how much"" not ""how"".

I have seen some apparent similarities between the cultures of Ancient Rome and ""conservative"" Latin America but I am unsure if I am projecting too much of the present onto the past.

I am also not sure how much of what I say applies to almost every culture on Earth.

The main areas of similarities I see are:

  1. Family
  2. Politics
  3. Legal system
  4. Economics

(Long text ahead that isn't necessary to understand my question)

In both cultures families include servants or maids. Until recently, it was common place for maids to sleep on their employers house for most of the week. Old buildings feature small bedrooms and small restrooms for maids near the ""service area"" (*área de serviço*, the place of the house where the laundry is done).

Also, family members are seen as sort of subjects of the head of the household.

Whenever the state wants to implement a rule that would restrict the powers of the head of the household they are usually opposed by a large number of people.

Recent examples include: workers rights for maids, child spanking ban, teaching of african culture and history, teaching of evolution, teaching of queer people.

This seems related to the idea that not everyone should have rights. Lower ranking people (e.g. poor, disabled, queer) should just ""accept"" when they are mistreated either by private or public agents.

The rank of a person seems to be related to how active/outdoorsy they are and how many people they command. ""No homo"" seems to apply if you top.

Both cultures have festivals in which said rules were broken: Saturnalia and Carnival.

In politics, both culture seem to revolve arround ""famous leaders"" and elections are an afterthought.

If someone doesn't vote the ""right way"" (i.e. poor people voting for leftist politicians) they are accused of ""not knowing how to vote"".

Political parties seem like mere fandoms instead of proper insitutions. People care a lot more about the individual politicians than ideology.

Scandals seem to only matter when political rivals do it. The hard core ""fans"" tolerate transgressions no matter what.

Politics seem to be reserved for the ""right people"" and when low ranking people try to be active in politics they are seen with distrust and as if they violating some sacred rule.

It seems that rank is inversely related to following rules and having high expections from others. If you are a ""low level worker"" people desire a lot from you (e.g. perfect and fast work) and get furious if you break even small rules. If you are a plantation owner, people don't really expect a lot from you and accept that you will break the rules.

When a high ranking person commits a crime, they usually find a way out of being punished while low rank people are jailed for crimes they didn't even commit.

Finally, both cultures seem to have economic systems with large class divide and based mostly on agriculture and extraction with relatively little industry. The entire system seems dependent on cheap unskilled labour.","How ""culturally Roman"" is (conservative) Latin America?",gjvnq1

The following passage from Robin DiAngelo's *White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism* (2018) is representative:

&gt;As a sociologist, I am quite comfortable generalizing; social life is patterned and predictable in measurable ways. But I understand that my generalizations may cause some defensiveness for the white people about whom I am generalizing, given how cherished the ideology of individualism is in our culture. There are, of course, exceptions, but patterns are recognized as such precisely because they are recurring and predictable. We cannot understand modern forms of racism if we cannot or will not explore patterns of group behavior and their effects on individuals.

Until today, this is basically what I thought ""society"" in the sociological sense meant: recurring and predictable patterns that can be measured, named, and thereby understood. (And, being understood, presumably then used to do things, e.x. anti-racism initiatives, etc.). 

However, recently on twitter I saw several people making fun of this passage, saying (more or less) that this account of society has essentially no overlap with 'actual,' rigorous sociological concepts or work.

In the world of today, we live in an era of abundance and/or excess, with an advancement that is so fast-paced that the rate keeps on skyrocketing by the second.

In the world of today, things are much more accessible, available and more possible than ever:

* Things can be accessed, stored and transferred in the blink of an eye and the world of today is literally swimming in an ocean of information (which is why it is called the information era)
* With the technology and the level of understanding of many things today, things can be made in a short period of time – machines making thousands or even millions of products and pumping them out and great quantities
* And with the level of globalisation that we are in today, there are simultaneously many things and places around the world that are simultaneously expanding, advancing, producing, and doing and reacting in any way, place and form

This, of course, gives us a lot more room for variety and many things are of various degrees in quality, taste and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

But then you will realise something.

You go to a video game store like Steam or go on Netflix, or a library, and you see all of these options.

&amp;#x200B;

And to add to that, these lists often change as the algorithms are often updated, whether it is because of ongoing trends or things that fit in your recent activity or what you saw yesterday or better yet, what you did a Google search on yesterday or what you said on your smartphone microphone.

And to even add another thing to this, multiple things are often constantly being updated and/or advance as well – new TV episodes, sequels and prequels of stories, books, video games, or the current ongoing trends and discussions of every single fandom or news are constantly being updated like a Reddit thread that gets longer each time you refresh the page – then add that to multiple threads being extended … and to add another layer to this, sometimes the home page even changes so may not always get the same list of contents twice on the main page.

&amp;#x200B;

According to my understanding of human attention and memory, a human being can only do so much – we have a limited attention span, our minds (while very capable and versatile) is limited in their brainpower, and to switch and shift from one subject to another is not really an easy thing to do (imagine switching subjects in a school in a short amount of time), let alone having to go deeper within each subject and hoping that the level inside your brain, whether it is knowledge or mental skill or attention or understanding, increases as well which also takes time, effort and a lot of mental and physical attention.

It is as though we are given a lot of stuff that we can choose from like being in a candy store where there are also other kinds of candy stores and even other fancy stores around, where each one is filled to the prime with all kinds of delicacies and treats … but we can only buy or consume so much at a given rate, especially when we are told that these things may either get sold out or expire or die out because of changing trends.

It is like a bottleneck effect where we want to get all of the things and these things have a limited lifespan before their quality are deemed as good or relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you might say that this is all a thing in the mind and maybe so.

Perhaps this is all done via unconscious social means because of peer pressure and you are anxious to consume these things like everyone else is so that you do not miss out on the fun but you miss out on other things or not be as immersed because you are doing it because you are pressured to do so and not because you want to.

Or it could be a psychological issue because you have lots of interests and hobbies and needs but can only do so much at any given rate similar to having an 8-hour shift where the lists of tasks are either increasing or updating and so on. Let alone that we currently live in an era that we constantly bombarded with stimulation and/or the need for stimulation and information over and over and over again with that constant feed and need of dopamine without rest or pause.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - I think that this is a real issue in the world of today, whether it is video games, TV, film, art, books, education, news, etc because many of us have lots of interests, whether it is in multiple subjects like you could be an artist and a banker; and/or interests in multiple creative entities in a particular thing like you can be a fan of multiple franchises and fandoms.**

AskSocialScience,"A useful group for a comparison is college students.  Historically college students have included a fair-sized cohort that drank and used drugs with fair abandon.    What sort of conclusions can be drawn by comparing this cohort to similar aged (18 - 25) people in low income neighborhoods (and not in college) who also engage in regular or chronic drinking and drug use *or abuse*? (Let's consider both alcohol and drugs.)

To be sure, people from all education, income and intelligence levels can and do get addicted to drugs and suffer accordingly.  But without looking at any statistical data, such as exists, might we be able to deduce that the **discipline** that keeps students pursuing academic achievement and life-time career goals, acts, in many cases, to moderate the the worst outcomes of drug and alcohol use?  A similar conclusion might be drawn for people in trade schools (plumbing, electrical) or people *disciplined enough* to work 60-hour weeks developing a business.  Or people who have invested 20 years in the same career.

What does social science have to say here?   

The answer might have policy implications.  America is increasingly supporting drug liberalization, e.g.,  [PBS: Push to relax drug laws gains big victories...](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/future-voting-rights-marijuana-laws-at-stake-in-several-states).   At the same time the nation is focusing more on addressing poverty, particularly in black communities.  These communities are part of the lobbying effort against current drug enforcement policies.  Example: [End Broken Windows Policing](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/brokenwindows):
 
&gt;A...focus on minor crimes...has led to the...over-policing of communities of color...in otherwise harmless situations...Decriminalize these activities or de-prioritize their enforcement:   Consumption of Alcohol on Street, Marijuana Possession, Disorderly Conduct, Trespassing, Loitering, Disturbing the Peace (including Loud Music), etc. [*partial list*].

No doubt, over-criminalization is a big problem; numerous sources discuss it, e.g.: [PBS: The Problem with “Broken Windows” Policing](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-broken-windows-policing/).   But the issues here are somewhat separate from the question: **Should the campaign against poverty include efforts to increase sobriety in low-income communities?** 


[Black people use drugs at a slightly lower rate](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/rates_of_drug_use_and_sales_by_race_rates_of_drug_related_criminal_justice) than white people.   Black people are cited here because they have been identified as a) being disproportionately poor and b) subject  to multiple external factors, e.g. systemic racism, that increase their poverty.

Should the inquiry into poverty among people *of any race* look into whether low income, low education people have more success-hindering problems  from drug and  alcohol use, such as  a) failure to remain employed, and b) public disorder   and other crime related to their drug habits?

AskSocialScience,"I feel like we, humans, treat age and history in the same regard. We believe that aging brings about wisdom. Sure, older people have more experiences and they might have seen more and met more people that doesn't mean they are smarter. Even when learning history, there is a sense that past events hold answers to current problems or that learning about the past prohibits us from making the same mistakes. There is also the assumption that we are more smarter now than we were before and that we can decipher the subliminal messages in the past from an elevated standpoint in the present.

Isn't this a grossly optimistic outlook? Hegel and other philosophers have, time and again, pointed out that history is not a trove of hidden answers. (Why I use Hegel is because he talks about history as a turnover of events, where the turnover is brought about by extremist practices of an ideology in that time period (ie Holocost was an extreme version of fascism; please correct me if I am wrong). Believing that the passage of time is accompanied by wisdom supposes that knowledge will eventually culminate into something, possibly the meaning of life with age or a utopian standard of living with history. This is really problematic, because neither have been proven yet.

So, how does this affect our daily lives? I think it is important to respect the elderly, but we should not romanticise their intellectual simply because they have lived long lives. We should reconfigure our perception of age. We should also change the way history is taught in school. There shouldn't be such a strong emphasis on cause-effect model in historical studies, instead it should take on a more narrative approach, treading through historical events.

AskSocialScience,"I originally made this post in another sub, but I didn’t get as much statistical data as I had hoped, and I wanted to get different takes on the topic. If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing (hopefully you at least read the important 
parts of it for the specific context of why I ask this question), skip to the last paragraph.

This post is a little bit all over the place, but let me give some background. My parents are Eritrean immigrants who came to the US in the mid to late eighties during Eritrea’s war with Ethiopia, and I was born in the US. Their general belief is that the social and economic oppression of a large portion of the working/lower class African American population in the US is the result of the characteristics of black “culture” (if there is  even such a thing as a unified African American culture) which promotes behaviors that allow them to be subjected to unfair treatment from other racial groups like white people. I don’t really have much of a viewpoint on this because I don’t believe I have the proper life experience to make that kind of judgement. Nevertheless, there is some dissonance in the subject that I would like to get some clarification on:

Many of our parents and family members in the Habesha community (Ethiopian/Eritrean community) came to the US as refugees during the eighties and nineties (some even as early as the seventies). A large number of them are not particularly educated, with many of them having fled their country from villages/rural areas. It is not uncommon for many of our parents to have never completed elementary school. Even from the small minority of those who were able to receive a university degree in their home country, their degrees are generally largely unusable in the US for employment purposes, and so their job prospects are similar to other refugees.

When they come here, they generally work minimum wage jobs, work under the table for cash, and live in low income housing. My understanding from what they tell us is that they work a lot and save up money (along with being on welfare of course) until they can move out of the low income housing, and then they find a wife/husband and have children somewhere else. If they want keep taking advantage of the low cost living, they remain in low income housing, get married, and have kids, and once the kids are old enough that they can be “influenced by the hood mentality” (their words), the parents are somehow able to take their kids and leave the neighborhood.

Despite this, our parents still work low income jobs and receive welfare benefits, but their kids enjoy a typical, middle class life. I don’t know the details of everyone’s finances, so I am unaware of how exactly they manage, but in the grand scheme, our families generally don’t face many unbearable financial hardships due to living in America. In addition, there is pressure for our parents to send money back to Africa for their parents/siblings/extended family and friends, which many (especially men) do quite often. But socioeconomically, they remain at the same status throughout their lives as refugees. In my neighborhood alone, there have always been around 5 to 10 taxi cabs sitting around, all owned and driven by Eritreans/Ethiopians, and that typically ends up being their livelihood until they stop working. Some woman stay at home to raise their children, while others work menial jobs to support the household.

Any kind of generational wealth for us is obviously non existent, and so it is in our family’s interest for us to “become successful” in our careers. Although our parents’ socioeconomic status has not and probably will not change in the US, the American born youth of the community has become quite successful, with many US born children having already received their PhDs and earning high salaries.

To white people and other non-African minorities, we appear as black. We still receive plenty of microaggression on account of our race. My father has been pulled over by the police numerous times when driving alone for matching certain suspicious profiles. My mother and I have been followed around in stores countless times and have been watched carefully by several employees at the checkout line. Even when passing by someone’s house at night in my neighborhood, there are some people who, instead of entering their house after exiting their car, stand by their front door and watch us until we pass by before opening their front door and entering their house. A lot of this behavior does come from other uneducated foreigners, but definitely not all of it. My mother has a English sounding last name, and so on paper, she is often mistaken for a white woman. When making doctors appointments, people’s tones immediately change once they hear that she has an accent. She recently wanted to buy a used car from someone, and when the lady who was selling it spoke to her (she was white), she became very nervous and kept asking whether or not the woman who had initially messaged her was really her (this woman had been very enthusiastic about selling my mother the car before this). The woman then kept asking my mother about where exactly she lived, how many kids she had, where she worked, and a bunch of other irrelevant questions, and she kept slowly trying to back out of the transaction. My mother was fully aware of what was happening, and she assured her that she didn’t have to sell if she didn’t want to, told her to have a nice day, and decided not to talk with her any further. Growing up, I took violin lessons, and in the first couple of lessons, my mother would come with me. The (white) teacher flat out told me to tell my mother she expected a regular check payment every month and that she “doesn’t like checks that bounce” (her exact words).

These are just a few of many experiences involving race that I have had growing up, but because my parents always had such a seemingly nonchalant attitude about it, I never learned to be offended by any of it. In fact,  my mother and I found it pretty hilarious most of the time.

TL;DR: I know it is unfair to make sweeping comparisons, but I have always been genuinely confused as to how related the “black American” experience is today for African Americans and for African refugees. Despite the humble beginnings of African refugees in America, it is my understanding that their first generation children in America end up rising above the status they grew up with. I don’t know too much about the Somali community, but from those I have known, their experiences seem to be similar. I am certain that there are a lot of holes in my knowledge, and so that’s why I wanted to ask reddit to clear up whatever ignorance and help me learn more. First of all, do children of African immigrants (specifically refugees) do better on average than African Americans economically, and if so, are there any concrete correlations that can be associated with this? Do they face similar systemic disadvantages? Is it easier for someone like me or my parents to not be offended by racist behavior/attitudes towards us? Am I facing a lot of confirmation bias by growing up in the environment that I did? Is any comparison between the two groups valid at all?

Then I started reading on Wikipedia about modern applications and one was this

&gt; Volume and Control Model,[2] describes how information is capitalized by global corporations and transforms into economic power. Volume is defined as the informational resources—the amount and diversity of information and the people producing it. *Control is the ability to channel the interaction between information and people through two competing mechanisms: popularization (information relevant to most people), and personalization (information relevant to each individual person).*

I lost them at the point where they discussed the two competing mechanisms, what does this mean?



&gt;According to this understanding, knowledge is never neutral, as it determines force relations. The notion of power-knowledge is therefore likely to be employed in critical, normative contexts. One example of the implications of power-knowledge is Google’s monopoly of knowledge, its PageRank algorithm, and its inevitable commercial and cultural biases around the world, which are based on the volume and control principles. A recent study shows, for example, the commercial implications of Google Images algorithm, as all search results for the term 'beauty' in different languages predominantly yield images of white young females.[2]

AskSocialScience,"A general sense you get traveling through areas of internet-land on these issues is that Geneticists are sometimes running into dangerous territory when they talk or report about their findings on things like heritable behavioral traits. For example, Robert Plomin's book *Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are* contains a forward about how he could not have written this book years ago, due to the social science being unfriendly to notions of connecting personality and behavior to anything genetic. He also remarks that colleagues told him it was ""career suicide"" to publish such a work.

The trope is that this is connected to our modern culture wars, in which left-leaning centers of academic opinion may want to push a 'blank slate' ideology, and be hostile to notions of genetic predisposition, and that such claims may evoke accusations of racism or sexism or the like.

 My question is basically - is this true?

Abstract: This paper analyzes whether teachers’ attention to boys and girls differs in low-performing schools in Chile, where large gender gaps in test scores are also observed. We coded 237 videotaped classes of fourth graders, identifying specific behaviors of teachers toward boys and girls. **The results show a general imbalance in teachers’ attention and interactions favoring boys. Gender attention gap is correlated with lower scores in math for girls on Chile’s national standardized test (SIMCE).** The gender attention gap was also greater in general in classrooms in which teachers had overall worse interactions with students, as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). The evidence in this paper contributes to the discussion about whether traditional measures of teacher–student interactions really capture all that matters for learning.

After reading through the study, I first got the impression that teachers give unequal attention to boys and girls and this unequal treatment is an explanatory factor for the math score gap between the two sexes. The whole tone of the paper seems to suggest this. But **Table 9** seems to paint a different picture. Although gender bias is negatively correlated with girls' math performance, this negative correlation is even stronger for boys (regarding teacher-initiated actions). Ending the unequal treatment would possibly increase the gap instead of closing it.

AskSocialScience,"In 1960s around 90-95% of people living in Scandinavian countries were Protestant. Today that number is steadily decreasing and is now down to 60-70% with atheism being anywhere from around 24% (in Denmark - as opposed to less than 5% in the 1960s) to 35% (in Sweden, as opposed to less than 5% in the 1960s). Similar thing happened in the Netherlands, Latvia and Estonia - although historically predominantly Protestant they too had seen a drastic decline of Protestantism - so much so that today Catholicism is the largest religion in the Netherlands (down from 30% to 24% since the 1890s as opposed to Protestantism's decline from 65% to 15% in the same period. 50% are irreligious, as opposed to less than 5% in the 1890s) and Orthodoxy in Estonia and Latvia (share of Protestants was down from 80% (for Estonia) and 66% (in Latvia) in 1930s to 15% (in Estonia) in 2011 and 17% (in Latvia) in 2018. No data for Orthodoxy in 1930s, but it has seen increase from 13% to 16% from 2000 to 2011(in Estonia) and from 22% to 26% from 2000 to 2018 (in Latvia). Irreligion is at 55% in Estonia and 15% in Latvia. No data for prior irreligion rates apart from irreligion being less than 20% in Estonia in 1930s). In all cases irreligion steadily increased which seems to offer correlation (although not definitive causation as this is all the data i have) between the rise in irreligious membership and decline in Protestant membership. But same correlation could be found in rise of non-Protestant religions and decline in Protestant ones (share of non-protestant religious people in Denmark, for example, increased from 5% to 15% within 60 years and from 5% to 10% within 130 years in the Netherlands) but i have no immigration records of any of these countries to determine how much of loss of Protestant membership is actually attributed to Protestants converting to other religions. One thing that might hint towards *this* causation is the fact that both Estonia and Latvia saw decrease in Orthodox minorities during the same period when Orthodoxy was on the rise in terms of numbers and percentage-wise (although reasons for this phenomenon could be manyfold and not necessarily hinting towards Protestant conversion to Orthodoxy)

Also, in all 6 cases dominant form of Protestantism was Calvinism (in the Netherlands) and Lutheranism (all other countries), so maybe that plays a more definitive role instead of Protestantism as a whole?

I have carried out a survey for my research study. Most questions were open ended for qualitative analysis, but a few were closed questions with the hope of presenting in descriptive manner with  basic statistics (pie charts and bar charts) to illustrate my respondents demographics. 

Question 1 - I sent the survey to two groups and received 35 responses for the first group and 14 for the other. Is it still appropriate to present my respondents demographic categories in pie charts with so few respondents in one group? It is part of the study’s aim, but having doubts due to the low numbers. 

Question 2 - I missed a detail when configuring the survey to my question ”How often do you make online purchases per month?” so instead responding single numbers a lot of respondents wrote ”1-3”, ”3”, ”5-7”, ”3-5” and so on.

AskSocialScience,"So I was doing some cursory reading regarding population growth and I had a few questions I wanted to ask so as to clarify certain elements.

1. How does population growth relate to quality of life, and to what extent?

According to the very little reading I've been doing, it seems that population growth is negatively associated with quality of life. I wanted to ask this subreddit to see if this was general consensus. Further, I also wanted to know as to the extent of the relationship, as if, for instance, if sharp increases in population only marginally impact the QoL, or if both items are extremely related in their respective increases and declines.

2. Assuming pop. growth is negatively associated with QoL, can a nation with a declining population make up for lost growth with improved health outcomes?

This question is weird so I fully acknowledge I may not get a straight answer, but I was curious as to if the declines in population are in anyway offset or even surpassed by improvements to quality of life, and health outcomes is the only metric that I was aware of that came to mind.

AskSocialScience,"Hi,

Basically I'm feeling a bit downhearted. 

I've heard some people argue with me that moderate social progress even in the direction of a swedish welfare state allegeldy leads to authoritarian dictatorships or authoritarian socialism. I've heard that any reform like a progressive tax just creates capital flight and leaves a country without any manufacturing base and that the world can only exist how it does now otherwise it will be a horrible dictatorial place.

Now naturally I don't believe that but then the question inevitably arises what makes some reforms work and what makes some reforms more authoritarian.

For example the state in my country runs the healthcare system, its completely nationalised but its not authoritarian in any sense, likewise the broadcast media but its not authoritarian. Is it only authoritarian if its a monopoly? But then there are several european countries which have nationalised natural monopolies and there not authoritarian.

I know my questions a bit jumbled but I guess the route of it is that surely all social progress starts of with a policy proposal that is utopian, and at some point youve got to throw caution to the wind to see if it works.

I recently saw a post about people rightfully complaining about racism in fifa, where some people would create offensive characters with black skin, caricatural facial features, and stereotyped african names.

Going from this thread, this made wonder about character creation as a whole in the past few days. When creating an avatar for a game, it can be argued that our intentions can reflect some stereotypes or conceptions that we have about certain people. Let's say that If test subjects were to play as an attractive character, the created avatar facial features could be an objective measurement of their subjective conception of beauty.

Going forward, when people play RPG and want to RP as a character with a certain personnality, eg : a thief, a mage, a succesful merchant, or whatever. It could be interesting to see if people tend to use similar facial features. It can also be translated to an experimental procedure : let's say I read the description of a character using only personnality traits, and then ask participants to create such character, I think it could be a good way to observe stereotypes.

My questions are as follow : 

What do you think could be other interesting concepts that could be highlighted through character creation ? 

Are there exemple from the litterature using character creation as a task, and what did it measure ?

(headline of section:)  Unintended Consequences: Criminal justice reform in California removed
incentives to enter drug treatment.

&gt;...a measure called Proposition 47 is resulting in more low-level drug offenders on the street, and fewer in treatment. Approved by California voters in November 2014, Proposition 47 downgraded a wide range of theft and drug offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. Many suspects accused of these crimes now receive only a citation and little chance of jail time.

&gt;One consequence of Proposition 47 is that without the threat of incarceration, the justice system lost much of the leverage it once had to get people into drug treatment programs.

&gt;“Low-level drug offenses became misdemeanors. In California, that’s a citation, no matter how many times you’re caught, so there’s no incentive to stop reoffending,” said Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell, whose agency operates the largest jail in the nation and is the second largest police agency in the United States. “Before, people facing jail time would eventually accept treatment, but now that leverage is gone. And the number of people in treatment went down after that.”

To my understanding, and perhaps this can be clarified, non-law-enforcement-directed drug treatment programs are *voluntary* (outreach?), with people with drug issues asked or persuaded to enter treatment.  How do the two approaches compare in their successes, or lack thereof?

I’m trying to find out if people were “happy” (satisfied/content with their lives) under socialism during the Cold War, and I need Sociology’s help in answering this: What do people prefer?

Please read all of the below before answering, or abstain from answering. Excuse my English, I’m Argentinian. Thank you.

To the West, Freedom essentially means **freedom of press, of speech, of movement and freedom of religion.** In the west all these things were greater than in the east.

To socialism, instead, **freedom means to being free from the “economic chains” of a system.** For example: if you don’t have a guaranteed job, you know you can be fired and as such suffering hunger is a real possibility. You tremble thinking what to do if you get fired and therefore being without money, necessary to feed and provide health to your family. Therefore, job insecurity is an “economic chain” of capitalism, which socialism got rid off. **In this system, you just lived, while under capitalism you have to worry about being able to survive.** Therefore, this type of liberty/freedom was much more prevalent in the east.

AskSocialScience,"It is claimed by a large amount of activists and organizations like EqualityNow that completely legalized or decriminalized prostitution leads to more abuse of prostitutes and human trafficking. There are a variety of arguments they put forth to advance this idea.

Most frequent is [the claim that countries with completely legalized prostitution experience more human trafficking](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/45198/1/Neumayer_Legalized_Prostitution_Increase_2012.pdf), and that pro-sex worker organizations are staffed by [abusers themselves.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/22/pimp-amnesty-prostitution-policy-sex-trade-decriminalise-brothel-keepers)

In contrast, Sweden has seen the number of trafficking victims,

&gt; [reduced by two thirds, and the number of johns has been reduced by 80%.” Trafficking is reportedly down to 200 to 400 girls and women a year, compared with 15,000 to 17,000 in nearby Finland.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/03/why-is-prostitution-illegal.html)

They also attack what they see as common assumptions of pre-legalization activists. Counter to what many say, one proposed benefit of the Nordicc model is that legalized prostitution makes it difficult to secure convictions in cases of sexual assault.

&gt;In legalised and decriminalised systems it is often extremely difficult for prostituted women to secure convictions against buyers for sexual assault, or even to have police and prosecutors take such cases seriously. Whereas, under the Nordic Model, a buyer can be charged automatically, simply as a result of having paid for sex.

In addition, decriminalization in nations like New Zealand and Germany does not seem to have increased the likelihood that prostitutes will report abuse.

&gt;full decriminalisation has not been found to offer any great police protection. The New Zealand government’s five-year review of the Prostitution Reform Act showed that a majority of respondents felt that decriminalisation made no difference with respect to the violence of johns \[buyers\] in prostitution, that “few” prostituted persons “reported any of the incidents of violence or crimes against them to the Police.”

To the idea that models such as these merely drives it underground, this is challenged by the fact that less people have reported buying sex in Sweden, and police have intercepted transmissions calling the country a ""bad market,"" and the malleability of the term ""underground.""

Other sources purporting to refute these supposed benefits come from reports from German prosecutors, where over one third stated that legalization “made their work in prosecuting trafficking in human beings and pimping more difficult,” with other studies stating that there were “no viable indications that the \[law\] has reduced crime,” and that ""Hardly any women in prostitution registered as an employee with a social insurance agency, and thus were **not afforded greater social protection** and benefits like health insurance and pension insurance."" These reports seem to have influenced the European Parliament, who largely accepts them.

And lastly, it's suggested that legalization can actually drive women into illegal forms of prostitution.

&gt;One goal of legalized prostitution was to move prostituted women indoors into brothels and clubs where they would be allegedly less vulnerable than in street prostitution. However, many women are in street prostitution because they want to avoid being controlled and exploited by pimps (transformed in legalized systems into sex businessmen). Other women do not want to register or submit to health checks, as required by law in some countries where prostitution is legalized (Schelzig, 2002). Thus, legalization may actually drive some women into street prostitution. Arguing against an Italian proposal for legalized prostitution, Esohe Aghatise has suggested that brothels actually deprive women of what little protection they may have on the street, confining women to closed spaces where they have little chance of meeting outreach workers or others who might help them exit prostitution (Aghatise, in press).

This is a lot to take in, and I'm sure the evidence on this front was complicated, but I was always led to believe that the majority opinion about this topic was that legalization was the best option. Are these reports about the efficacy of the Nordic model and the inefficiency of legalization accurate? Or is there something missing here?

The Philippines is basically adopted Spaniard culture in all but the tongue on the surface. Architecture, religions, social customs, traditional clothing, music, and so on are indistinguishable from Latin America. Even the main language has a lot of loan words from Portuguese and Spanish. Yet Philippines is classified under SouthEast Asian culture despite outsiders often mistaking pictures of the country as being Mexico or Cuba or some other Latin American place. The biggest arguments about why Filipinos are not Hispanic or even Latino is primarily because Spanish is not the tongue of the country and Tagalog is not romance either in the way Portugal is which is why Brazil is classified as a Latin country. Tagalog is far closer to Austronesian, the family language of Indonesia and Malaysia along with much of SouthEast Asia so Philippines is not considered Hispanic or Latino but within the Austronesian cultural grouping even with the major amount of Spanish in various Filipino tongues.

AskSocialScience,"I'm looking for concepts or theoretical frameworks similar to what Jacques Derrida called ""autoimmunity."" Naturally, this is a metaphor that draws on the concept of the immune system of an organism attacking the organism itself. In Derrida's metaphorical usage, what this refers to is any time when liberalism leaves things so open and free that the system is no longer to protect itself from any threats to freedom. Like I say in the title of the post, the key example is the democratic election of leaders with autocratic tendencies. Similarly, this could also describe the way that openness of a discussion forum could be so open that it effectively leads some people to feel like they can't actually be honest. Jo Freeman has used the term ""tyranny of structurelessness"" to talk about the ways that shunning hierarchical structure in small organizations means that not only do hierarchies emerge, but that no one can call them out because to call them out would be itself a speech act that places the speaker in a position of authority.

Given Derrida's rather opaque writing style, I'm paraphrasing what he means by autoimmunity since explicit definitions of his terms seem to be pretty rare in his writings.

Derrida develops the concept of autoimmunity here:

https://imgur.com/a/jWsmulO

In short: Patients arrive at the hospital and have their ""health measurements"" taken. It is also recorded whether they were immediately discharged from the hospital, or if they were required to stay. Given a new patient that enters the hospital and their health measurements are taken, I need to predict the response_variable for this patient - will they be immediately discharged from the hospital, or will they have to stay?

I have data from the last 50 years. It is obvious, that society, people's health and medicine have changed over the last 50 years (e.g. life expectancy has increased in many parts of the world). Perhaps in 1971, an elderly man who smoked his entire life would have had to stay for a prolonged period in the hospital - but in 2019, he might have been given a new drug that was developed in the last 5 years and then immediately discharged. The big question is : do these macro and micro time dependent trends within the variables need to be taken into account when creating statistical models?

So far, I created a decision tree (C5 algorithm) which completely ignores the ""time"" variable. That is, it is assumed that an elderly man from 1971 who smokes is identical to an elderly man that smokes in 2019. By completely ignoring the ""time"" variable, I was able to create a standard decision tree model that produces good results. I tested this two different ways:

1st way: I trained the decision tree using a random 70% sample of the data, and recorded its performance on the remaining 30% of the data.

2nd way: I kept data from 2019 separate. I then trained a decision tree using using data from previous years. Then I recorded the performance of the decision tree on 2019's data.

In both tests, the performance of the decision tree was good enough for my requirements.

But is just makes me curious: (looking at the imgur picture) what kind of data do I have? In statistics, is this considered Panel Data? Cross Section Data? Longitudinal Data? Time Series Data?

I have a feeling that is not longitudinal data - as far as I understand, longitudinal data repeatedly records measurements on the same patient (e.g. once every year). As far as I am concerned, all patients in my data are unique. Perhaps I am dealing with multivariate time series data?

There were some further delineations of the type of yelling/weapon/firearm and the actions that both the perpetrator of the crime and the victim took. This was all in a big table, and one of the most interesting notes was that it seemed, based on the data/what I can remember, that just yelling at a burglar would have a better outcome in terms of the victim's personal safety than using or brandishing a firearm. 

Hope someone can help me find this! I'd really love to dive into the study deeper since I've gotten a lot better versed in amateur research (in no small part thanks to this sub) compared to where I was a few years ago when I initially found the study.

AskSocialScience,"As someone watching the US elections from outside, I've been aware of the general proceedings, with the Electoral College and all that jazz, but I've never followed them as closely as this year. 

Up until now, I assumed that the results called by news networks on election night were based on press releases from the election commissions of individual states, rather than the network's decision desks announcing the statistically likely winner. 

For some perspective, in my (much, much smaller) country, the news networks release the results of their exit polls at the time the polls close, and those are then updated as the state electoral commission releases the vote tallies throughout the night. While the networks may speculate on the outcome of the election, only the commission releases the ""official"" results (both preliminary and final). 

I'm aware the decision desks only announce the projected winner when there's a very high degree of certainty (with some famous exceptions), but how has it come to be that those results are accepted as basically official, not just by the US public but by foreign governments as well?",How and when did the practice of news networks calling the results of the US presidential elections originate?,Electron_Blue
AskSocialScience,"I guess there are several approaches, like straight up asking people how they would categorize themselves without forcing preexisting categories on them, or asking them which gender they're assigned to by governments or institutions (as some countries do [legally recognize non-binary genders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_recognition_of_non-binary_gender)).

I found some articles on Google Scholar on the subject ([this one](https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RFS_594_0677--lgbt-and-non-binary-people-in-boxes.htm), [this one](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/case-for-nonbinary-gender-questions-in-surveys/D9E67233FC530D352C31E9D73216228E), or [this one](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10598650.2018.1484201) for example), but I'm still not sure if there is some kind of consensus among social science researchers on how to deal with this kind of question.

I guess it depends a lot on what kind of question you have in the first place and what is the purpose of the survey, but anyway I'd like to learn about different approaches on how to set up surveys that include questions about gender.

AskSocialScience,"The success of the Portugal model with heroin addiction is clear: Treating addiction as a medical issue, providing heroin or methadone to addicts.   What seems less clear is how the Portugal model deals with recreational use of heroin and other other hard drugs. (Let's consider marijuana a non-issue). 

This 2017 article on Portugal's drug policy, [Portugal’s radical drugs policy is working. Why hasn’t the world copied it?](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it), offers some unusual perspectives:

&gt;Portugal’s policy rests on (several) pillars: one, that there’s no such thing as a soft or hard drug, only healthy and unhealthy relationships with drugs; two, that an individual’s unhealthy relationship with drugs often conceals frayed relationships with...the world around them...

&gt;I was told this again and again: thinking of drug addiction simply in terms of health and disease was too reductive. Some people are able to use drugs for years without any major disruption to their personal or professional relationships. It only became a problem, they told me, when it became a problem...  (Hereafter: **Point A**)

&gt;Local activists have pressed João Goulão, Portugal’s drug czar, to legalize...cannabis...sale in Portugal; for years, he has responded that the time wasn’t right. Legalising a single substance would call into question the foundation of Portugal’s drug and harm-reduction philosophy. If the drugs aren’t the problem, if the problem is the relationship with drugs, if there’s no such thing as a hard or a soft drug, and if all illicit substances are to be treated equally, he argued, then shouldn’t all drugs be legalised and regulated?

How do these perspectives translate into a drug policy? What messages should drug educators ideally, i.e., for most effectiveness in controlling the harms of drugs, impart to prospective drug users and addicts? 

This [2016 article on Portugal and drugs](https://www.vice.com/en/article/59eqqk/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin) offers more detail on procedure:

&gt;Portuguese authorities don't arrest...(people with)...less than a 10-day supply of an illicit drug...Instead, drug offenders...are ordered to appear before so- called ""dissuasion panels"" made up of legal, social, and psychological experts...Most cases are simply suspended...  *(Presumably, marijuana)*

&gt;For those who have been repeatedly caught or are identified as addicts, the panels can order sanctions or treatment. Recreational users may face fines or be ordered to provide community service...

This overview still leaves uncertainty as to the messaging about drugs.  **Questions on Point A:**  Last two sentences: entirely true. This could be termed recreational drug use. But is this what drug educators ought to be informing people?  Doesn't everyone who starts using drugs--or ponders doing so--think they will be in the group that can use them without problem?  (Maybe only 20-25% of all hard drug users rank here??)

Also, most writings on the Portugal model discuss only heroin and marijuana; much less is written on meth, cocaine, crack, ecstasy, designer drugs, PCP -- drugs that are fairly common in America.  The second link writes:

&gt;Though heroin use is often highlighted to show the efficacy of Portugal's model, today most users that come before panels are in fact caught with either hashish or cannabis.

Do Portugal's drug policies reflect experience with those other drugs and the addictions that they sometime cause?   Can Social Science clarify Portugal's thinking on illegal drugs and explain why that nation's approach is regarded as one of the most coherent?

AskSocialScience,"My main motivation for posting here is a simple but vague question: what percentage of Americans are racist?

I did try looking for some polls/studies on this, but I came up surprisingly short. A lot of polls are polls of how Americans view the status of racial equality in the country rather than an assessment of what I would consider ""racial views"" - in other words, whether somebody believes races are/aren't social constructs, whether they have positive or negative opinions of certain races and ethnicities, etc. I've found one poll that I think most people have probably already seen, the one that suggests 9% of Americans sympathize with neo-Nazis. But that was a couple years ago, and I don't know how that result differs from, say, 20 years prior to the poll. Also, it specifically asks questions about white supremacist views, which, while definitely the most concerning racist ideology in America in my opinion, is also not necessarily representative of all racist views, which include black supremacy, antisemitism, Islamophobia, etc.

Now, I do recognize that racism is a bit of a spectrum, and the size of that spectrum is debatable. The line between outright racist views and racially insensitive/ignorant views is blurry. In other words, I'm not expecting to get a definitive percentage of Americans who are ""racist."" But I do feel it's feasible to get a grasp on, for example, what percentage of Americans believe black people are inferior or superior to white people, and potentially to what degree they think they are inferior/superior. So, rather than asking ""What percentage of Americans are racist?"", it might be more worth asking for polls or research into the specific racial/ethnic views of Americans.

AskSocialScience,"What do people with a low IQ (80 and less) do (career-wise)? Can an unintelligent person be a capable manager? Do they live mostly on social welfare? 

Does being unintelligent relate to poverty, or does poverty lead to a person being less intelligent? Will an unintelligent person born in a ""normal family"" end up poor (unless taken care of by the family)?

My initial statement mentions the idea of someone having a low IQ. I understand that people with certain disabilities would score lower on an IQ test, while still being intelligent. I am not talking about the cases where an IQ test is unreliable.

I've heard that unintelligent are losing their place in society (lecture by J. Peterson). Unintelligent people have more trouble finding jobs (everyone faces difficulties while searching for a job), especially with less demand in physical labor as they are being replaced by machines. That leads to poverty. And poverty leads to more uneducation, drugs, pregnancies, criminal behaviour. Or is it being born in poverty that causes this cycle to begin with?

[According to this website](https://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQtable.aspx), ~10% of people have an IQ lower than 80 (with a 15 SD, so I assume the number is not completely reliable). That would mean 800 million people are... pretty unintelligent? Isn't that a problem we should be worried about? Even in a western country like Spain, that is 500 thousand people out of 50 million. (even more, since the average IQ is 98 as opposed to 100)

*My reason for asking these questions:* I am a student. My parents are also graduates. According to some sources, I can safely assume our IQ is above 105. With that in mind, I assume that my social circles (within uni) and the family friends I grew up with have been rather intelligent people. I didn't have friends in school, so I didn't get to know people in that setting. I have no idea how unintelligent the other side of the world is. Is an IQ of 80 really stupid? Are they pretty much normal people that I wouldn't be able to differentiate in a random setting?

If I've made any wrong assumptions in my post, I am open to being corrected on the assumption rather than the idea that evolved from it. I am open to reading studies done on this topic. I don't study psychology/sociology, so I had trouble finding relevant articles on this topic.

A few days ago, I read this wonderful [article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/07/therapy-wars-revenge-of-freud-cognitive-behavioural-therapy) by Oliver Burkeman that seems to suggest that psychoanalytic therapies are well-positioned to address issues such as the root causes of mental suffering in ways that CBT is not and I have a few questions:

1) I was under the (possibly incorrect) impression that much of Freud's theories are largely considered to be pseudoscience and therapies based on them do not qualify as 'evidence-based' treatments. To what extent is this true?

2) Is psychoanalysis better positioned to treat the 'root cause' of mental illness than CBT or am I misreading this?
&gt;CBT embodies a very specific view of painful emotions: that they’re primarily something to be eliminated, or failing that, made tolerable. A condition such as depression, then, is a bit like a cancerous tumour: sure, it might be useful to figure out where it came from – but it’s far more important to get rid of it. CBT doesn’t exactly claim that happiness is easy, but it does imply that it’s relatively simple: your distress is caused by your irrational beliefs, and it’s within your power to seize hold of those beliefs and change them.

&gt; Psychoanalysts contend that things are much more complicated. For one thing, psychological pain needs first not to be eliminated, but understood. From this perspective, depression is less like a tumour and more like a stabbing pain in your abdomen: it’s telling you something, and you need to find out what. (No responsible GP would just pump you with painkillers and send you home.) And happiness – if such a thing is even achievable – is a much murkier matter. We don’t really know our own minds, and we often have powerful motives for keeping things that way. We see life through the lens of our earliest relationships, though we usually don’t realise it; we want contradictory things; and change is slow and hard. Our conscious minds are tiny iceberg-tips on the dark ocean of the unconscious – and you can’t truly explore that ocean by means of CBT’s simple, standardised, science-tested steps.

3) Is it accurate to say that CBT sees mental illnesses such as depression as symptoms of irrational thinking?
&gt; For traditional psychoanalysts – and those who practise newer “psychodynamic” techniques, largely derived from traditional psychoanalysis – what happens in therapy is that seemingly irrational symptoms, such as the endless repetition of self-defeating patterns in love or work, are revealed to be at least somewhat rational. They’re responses that made sense in the context of the patient’s earliest experience. (If a parent abandoned you, years ago, it’s not so strange to live in constant dread that your spouse might do so too – and thus to act in ways that screw up your marriage as a result.) CBT flips that on its head. Emotions that might appear rational – such as feeling depressed about what a catastrophe your life is – stand exposed as the result of irrational thinking. Sure, you lost your job; but it doesn’t follow that everything will be awful forever.

AskSocialScience,"Since ancient times, humans tried to find ways to explain the origins and mechanisms of the universe and the explanation and worship of many deities are one of them.

And many mythologies involve many deities or supernatural beings of many kinds - some have even more than one, benevolent, malevolent or somewhere in between.

&amp;#x200B;

Some were described with eloborate physical features like having body parts that are found in other animals like Ra and his falcon head or Anibus or winged human-like bulls in Mesopotamia; or have the ability to take shape of something or are a representation of something like Osiris and his green skin or Hel whose half of her body is either dead or old. 

But as mythologies and religions evolved, many religions (including ones that still exist today) shifted to the worship of deities that are either nameless or formless but also omnipotent and not exactly specific representations of a certain trait or feat like the Jewish religion, God does not have a specific name because it is too considered as too sacred; or Abramahic religions like Christianity and Islam simply call God as God or Allah with no distinctive name like in previous deities.

AskSocialScience,"Hello,

I’m working on a paper about the main differences between the theism and animism in regards to lawmaking. 

The way I understand human history, “indigenous” philosophy was born with us right at the beginning of humanity, and it is an animist perspective of our place in the world and universe. That is, we are embedded in circular relations with all the spirits in the world, and we as humans have our place in maintaining harmony like the mountains and the birds and every other relation. This way of understanding life is the foundation we built as humans at our onset, which then spread around the world as we migrated out of Africa. This would be why aboriginal groups in Australia and indigenous groups in North America have similar perspectives regarding the manner in which resources are to be used for our survival — with gratitude and respect for the gifts other creatures give us. 

On the other hand, theism is markedly different. I think it emerged in Mesopotamia some 10,000 ago when an innovation in the way agriculture was practiced made it suddenly much more efficient, which allowed for growing group sizes, which then demanded innovations in social management. My belief is that in the process of division of labour between groups of strangers (because collectives had gotten so big that you couldn’t really be familiar with everyone in your community anymore), specializations occurred on family lines, and this caused a spiritual alienation between the “self” and the “others”. Over time the food producing families (since not every family needed to produce food anymore, a few were enough to provide for everyone) gained power, and the spiritual alienation resulted in theism, which is the belief that there is one almighty who imposes their vision on the whole world. This was the start of kings and empires, and as this form of agricultural society spread from the Fertile Crescent to the rest of the connected continents, the world as we know it today began. 

In theism, Law is imposed from the top down. There is an assumption that people in general cannot be trusted, and that good order is authoritarian. The king, or the clergy, or today the politicians are an exclusive class with more moral ability than the masses, and they have the god-given mandate to protect the masses from themselves by creating laws. Laws must be imposed by force when necessary — this is sovereignty. When groups under different kings/governments clash, they must attempt to conquer each other and subdue the other beneath the “right” laws. (Obviously this has a lot to do with resource hoarding and the economic benefit of the higher class, but the way I see it is that this is considered necessary to supply the empire with the resources to protect themselves from the next, inevitable threatening “other”). 

Here’s where my question starts:

How does animism differ in its conception of lawmaking? As far as I understand, Law exists in the universe, and every individual (human and not) has the ability to decipher it. Each is trusted to know what role they play in maintaining order, and when someone strays from the moral path, then they will suffer the consequences of causing imbalance. It is not necessary to forcibly impose law on each other. 

Am I completely off base? Have I oversimplified and missed some crucial similarities between animism and theism? Do you recommend any particular scholars who are exploring this issue as well for me to read up on?

Thank you for your time :)

In a nutshell, the Banality of Evil explores the subjective nature of evil as every human is capable of doing things that are considered as ""evil"" or ""wrong"" and can do or be forced to do them for all sorts of reasons.

One reason, in particular, is that because of authority as explored by the Milgram Shock Experiment, or when people are given authority and can give them the opportunity to abuse that power to others if the conditions are right like in the Standford Prison Experiment.

The Banality of Evil explores a lot on the story of Adolf Eichmann, a former member of the SS and one of the major organizers of the Holocaust. What made this story interesting was that when he was trailed for his actions, he claimed that he was simply following orders.

So in the case of Hitler's philosophy and the idea of the promise of the Third Reich and Aryan supremeacy, how was he able to convince entire groups of people to fight for his cause or support/sympathise his philosophy in some way?

I know that anti-Semitism has existed before WW2 and was also one of the scapegoats that were used to demonise the Jews for causing WW1 and other major historical events throughout history in the past.

And I also know that Hitler's personality and his development of the Nazi philosophy has been researched and speculated for many years.

But how did this translate to large groups of people simply neglecting morality and replacing the justification with fanatic zeal and genocide and war and other war crimes or crimes against humanity, and extreme support to the Fuhrer and the Nazi philosophy as though it is the supreme rule of all?","The Banality of Evil explores the subjectivity and the factors that are involved when people do things that are considered as ""evil"".

* Research on perception of purpose-driven jobs in general. Do people feel that purpose-driven = charity/low-paying?

AskSocialScience,"Did you know that behavior and mental illness can spread just like a viral contagion? Read wikipedia articles on Mass Psychogenic Illness, and the Dancing Plague of 1518. Also look up the social contagion in LeRoy NY in 2011.

Considering all this, we have to ask ourselves: how much is the Internet a fomite for the spread of psychogenic contagion? Are there inoculations we can utilize? How much of the toxic culture we're currently seeing (and have seen for a long time) be hypothesized to be of psychogenic contagion in origin?

If we compare mass psychogenic illness to a viral contagion, the virus must also have certain environmental requirements in order to infect the host. With Covid-19 as an example, it can only infect hosts with the ACE2 protein (found in humans and cats). In addition, viral spread needs certain conditions such as poor ventilation in enclosed spaces, lack of hygiene, refusal to wear a mask properly, etc. And with social contagion, certain environmental factors must exist--whether they be physical factors like lead in the drinking water (causing outbreaks of violence), or mental and spiritual factors like belief in witches, conspiracy theories, a general distrust of ""intellectuals,"" etc.

Considering all that, I think finding a social inoculation for a social contagion is really difficult (assuming this is a desirable thing to discover). First, you have to untangle the web of factors, and then find ways to counter them. Considering that social ""rights and wrongs"" are so subjective, I don't know if inoculation is even possible.

If discovering and utilizing social inoculations against social contagions is both possible and desirable, how might one go about it? What factors might one need to consider? What are some possible outcomes?

Observation: I've noticed that many posters on this sub struggle to formulate their question in such a way that it makes sense to a social scientist, and that it can be answered with clarity, precision, and defined limitations. Obviously, this means that these questions don't get the best possible answers.

One source of confusion is, understandably, concepts that we use in a specific way in the field, but that have a (related but) different meaning in everyday life. This happens a lot to most undergrad students, so it is not surprising that it should happen here.

Many times, this is fine, and after some back and forth with the poster, we get to the question they really want answered, or they learn something about the complexity of the topic, or the different meaning of their concept, etcetera. Personally, I find those moments very rewarding.

What often happens next makes me sad: the person asking the question removes their post. (This happens for comment threads, too.) Sad because for one, other people will have similar questions or confusions and now they can't lean on the curiosity of the previous poster. Also sad because there should be no shame at all in going through a learning process - in fact, I have nothing but respect for people who keep asking questions and listening until they understand.

AskSocialScience,"Hi, r/AskSocialScience. 

I am a commercial/corporate filmmaker and one of the products I sell are ""Intervention films"". These are films that are used to change the behavior of a target group and can be best used when the target group is already informed of the situation but doesn't quite comprehend the context of the situation.

For example, someone can know how dangerous it is to share their personal data online. But until our own data is stolen, we do not understand the context or the weight sharing our data personal online carries. 

This is the structure I have found these films to have:

1.	Introduction:
What is the action that is about to take place and why there is tension there?
2.	Action:
Execution of an intervention. By combining a ‘normal’ element and an ‘absurd’ element you can create the release of tension. For example, having a blind man drive a car.
3.	Revelation of the action:
The unknowing participants are revealed what is actually happening.
4.	Message:
A message explaining why the action took place and a link to some type of landing page where the viewers or target group can take further action on the matter.
5.	Landing page:
The landing page is either a flyer, poster, or website populated by images or videos or text about the campaign. It is a page where the target group can go to get more information on the campaign.

AskSocialScience,"The term ""fascism"" is thrown around a lot in political discussions, but I've noticed that its meaning seems to vary widely depending on who is talking. For some people, fascism is a rough synonym for authoritarianism, describing anything from the People's Republic of China to Nazi Germany. For others, it refers to something much more specific, although specific criteria used to define it seems to vary a lot. The only consistent defining features of fascism I can recognize among these more specific definitions is being far-right on the political spectrum, nationalistic, and authoritarian. With these things in mind, how do social scientists define fascism? Are there any major contemporary political movements that could be accurately described as fascist?

For example: One of the first things I noticed while browsing through various years' ""Crime in the United States"" publications is a sidenote stating that data on the number of persons convicted, prosecuted, and imprisoned are not collected by the UCR programme – only the number of people arrested. Therefore, the claim that FBI data shows that black people are disproportionately responsible for crimes can already be proven to be entirely unsubstantiated, without even needing to look at any numbers, as the number of people arrested for any given offense can't just be baselessly conflated with the number of people responsible for that offense. As per one of the supposed core maxims of the USA: ""innocent until proven guilty.

When it comes to national data on murders, the National Criminal Justice Reference Service reported many years ago: “The FBI Uniform Crime Report’s (UCR’s) ‘murder and non-negligent manslaughter’ data are so seriously flawed that the only figure they can provide criminologists is the number of deaths investigated by police as potentially criminal homicides, and the weapons use data reported by the UCR and the National Crime Survey (victimization data) are unreliable as well.” Another problem with the FBI data on crimes in general is: “If the same person commits multiple crimes simultaneously, then the most significant crime is the only one that receives a statistical notation in the UCR.”

A Capital News Services report in January found major differences in crime statistics reported by different agencies in Maryland. “In one county, for example, the FBI reported 13 people murdered; the state police listed 23 and the county, 26…The FBI also reported 23 fewer murders statewide in 2017 than the Maryland State Police did. In the 2016 reports, the FBI listed two more murders than the state police did.” This does not provide a great deal of confidence in the data from the FBI. According to Adam Wandt, a public policy professor at John Jay College: “Some states report better than others.” Despite these flaws, the data is all we have to work with nationally.

Using the 2018 data, 16,335 murder offenders are listed. Of those, 4,821 have their race listed as unknown (29.5%); 4,884 are listed as White (29.9%); 6,318 are listed as Black (38.7%); 1,576 are listed as Hispanic or Latino (9.6%); 312 are listed as other race (1.9%). However 8,375 of the 16,335 have their ethnicity listed as unknown. That is 51.2% of those listed. 14,396 of the 16,335 are either listed as Not Hispanic or are of unknown ethnicity (88.1%). Once again ethnicity data is very unreliable and skews the data. The police choose how to identify a person’s race and ethnicity. It is not that hard to ask a person to self identify. Of the 2018 victims 52.4% were black, 43.1% where white, and 2.8% are listed as other race while 15.4% are listed as Hispanic or Latino.

White people kill thousands of white people every year and no one ever talks about “white-on-white crime.” Googling “white-on-white crime” returns 2,200,000 results in .034 seconds; Googling black-on-black crime on the other hand returns 1,110,000,000 results in 0.45 seconds.That is 50 times more results for the term black-on-black crime. It has become a part of the English language in a way that white-on-white crime has not.

In 2018 using FBI data 10,310,960 persons were arrested. 1,654,282 were arrested for drug abuse violations; 1,001,329 for driving under the influence; 887,622 for larceny-theft; 395,800 for aggravated assault; 329,152 for disorderly conduct; 328,772 for drunkenness; and 11,970 for murder and non-negligent manslaughter.

When people use the term black-on-black crime they will typically follow that up with the number of murders over a period of time. The term is a euphemism for black murder of other blacks. Since murderers are only 0.12 percent of all arrestees in 2018, apparently those who use this term as a weapon are unconcerned about other crimes and victims.

Using the “black-on-black” crime argument you would think black people are the only ones killing each other. The circumstances related to the murders that are occurring are rarely taken into consideration. Of the murders and non-negligent manslaughters where circumstances are known, 24% of people were killed as the result of an argument; only 3.9% are during the course of a robbery; and just 4.3 % are gang related.

According to 2018 data, when race of offenders and victims are known, (which is in just 45.7 percent of murders), 81 percent of whites are listed as killed by other whites, 15.5 percent of whites are listed as killed by blacks, 88.9 percent of blacks are listed as killed by other blacks and 8 percent of blacks are listed as killed by whites.

Now, if under half the race of victims and offebders are known, and cops can alter data, is tgis really trustworthy?

https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/blog-posts/lie-of-diversity/

Jordan Peterson made this post some time ago. I fell into him a while ago before I became very quickly disillusioned with much of what he says.

However, he does raise some points here.
Basically, JP is trying to raise the point that
A) hiring based on diversity suggests that those differences between people are important that they have meaningful impacts, which essentially gives ammo to the racists?

B) intersectionality is infinite, so any attempt to meet it would not be enough. 

He says ""In consequence, I would like to suggest that the proper way to determine who gets what slice of which pie in a given organization is the manner in which employers are legally bound to hire: first, they must conduct an analysis of the job to determine and list its requirements; then, with certain exceptions they are required to hire, place or promote the person who is most qualified to undertake that job, regardless of attributes that are not relevant to the task. These include, in my opinion, the differences in race, sex, gender, and their combinations (as well as the other intrinsic differences we discussed) that are pushed so assiduously, self-righteously and thoughtlessly by the progressives who think they can replace comparatively well-functioning meritocracies, aimed at the solution of serious problems by the most qualified people with candidates chosen on the basis of attributes that would clearly be viewed as prejudicial if they were used as grounds for rejection, failure to promote, and firing.""

I feel that this misses the point that its not solely about the task. A employment position or going to a school has profound impacts on everyone, from the people around you at school or the workplace to your family and community. I guess my point is something about the diversity of experiences, in that those differences in experiences often relate to gender, sex, race, age, and SES status, so that may be relevant. 

I feel like I am not smart enough to mount a strong critique, so please help me. How do you counter this narrative? 

Can anyone comment on this?

Also, I'll post some studies about diversity that I've found and would like some feedback on, essentially the question of:

AskSocialScience,"Let's take Japanese as an example: their choices of words that pragmatically mean the same thing is contingent on social hierarchy — with different politeness levels to boot (*kudaketa*, *teinei*, and *keigo*). The words you vary greatly depending on whether you're talking to some on an equal social standing like a classmate, close friend, co-worker or someone on a higher status like parent or your manager. Honorifics too mean way more to them in everyday use than to English speakers, who can usually refer to their high school seniors with no need for honorifics without any fear of being called 'disrespectful'. 

The same holds true for Indonesian culture as well; 1st grade high schoolers must refer to their upperclassmen as 'Kak \[name\]' lest they be branded as 'disrespectful'.  Similar to the Japanese, Bahasa Indonesia is also categorized in forms of 'formal' and 'informal' language. 

I don't really see this linguistic distinction being that apparent in English speaking culture. While politeness to superiors is a universal thing in general, in English there doesn't seem to be a clear cut distinction between 'formal language' and 'informal language'.

AskSocialScience,"Hi:

Some research have found jealousy in heterosexual couples cause that an opposite sex-friendship of one member of the couple is frequently seen as a threat by the other member. 2 examples:

Worley, T &amp; Samp, J. 2014. Friendship Characteristics, Threat Appraisals, and Varieties of Jealousy about Romantic Partners’ Friendships. Interpersona: An International Journal on Personal Relationships, 8(2), 231-244

Gilchrist-Petty, E &amp; Bennet, L. K. 2019. Cross-Sex Best Friendships and the Experience and Expression of Jealousy within Romantic Relationships. Journal of Relationships Research Research 10, e18, 1–9.

As a consequence, I suspect there could be:

1. A non-written code between heterosexual males that says men should keep distance with other men’s girlfriends/wifes, specially between friends. For “keep distance” I mean try to not be too “nice”, outgoing, etc.
2. A non-written code between heterosexual females that says women should, in the same way, keep distance with other women’s boyfriends/husbands, specially between friends.

If that codes (ot al least one on them) exists, exceptions could be common, so that codes could be not necesarily strict. For example:

Code 1 (between males) exception example: when the woman (remember, another men’s partner, probably a friend’s) is not only an acquaintance but also a member of the group of friends. Then, confidence exist, so men can be more natural with her. However, men’s unwritten code (if exists) “bans” being too “nice”/outgoing with another men’s female partner if she is not a friend but only an acquaintance or frienship with her is very low. The code should be abided specially if the male partner of that woman is present.

Code 2 (between females) exception example: the same situation but exchanging sexes.

&gt; Fortunately, these huge increases in total number of people shot may not translate into equally immense increases in murders, because 2020’s shooters don’t seem as efficient at killing people. Fewer people appear to be dying per person shot this year. For example, murders are up only 35 percent in New York City due to a decline in marksmanship among Gotham’s would-be assassins.

&gt;This suggests that a large fraction of the Summer of George’s incremental shootings are by blacks, who historically have had the lowest ratio of kills to wounded. (Contrary to what you might assume from watching rap videos, holding your gun sideways doesn’t actually help you shoot straight.)

&gt;Although the national press has promoted the idea that almost all mass shootings are carried out by white male terrorists with rifles in schools or churches, those are rare, although horrifically lethal when they do happen.

AskSocialScience,"Hello! I’m from Spain, I’m male and I always wonder things about humanity. Recently, as an adult, I have became a psychology/sociology lover and read lot of research, but I haven’t studied that sciences at University yet.

My question now is this: How much people lie about their vote?

Sometimes I suspect people usually lie about their political ideas and, as a consequence, they lie about their real vote.

For example, if a man has right-wing ideas but in his social life usually deal with people from left-wing, he may lie about his own political ideas and/or his own vote (Of course, a woman could do the same, but I put a man in the example for avoiding write “he/she” and “his/her” everytime).

I suspect people lie A LOT about that kind of things, because social pressure may be strong, and people usually want to have social life, and someone who defy the ideology of the group takes the risk of being excluded.

However, is only my hypothesis and I haven’t read research papers about it. Can someone help me sending me research about that?

The issue is that I see a lot of great leaders who had great career paths and despite challenges in life were able to overcome them.

AskSocialScience,"Hello, dear redditors of this marvelous knoledge subreddit. I have this vague question in my mind of what actually are these entities we call organizations and institutions. After some thorough research on Wikipedia and Crash Course Sociology, I've come across concepts like formal organizations (i guess this is a concept from Weber's work, but I'm not sure?), institutional economics, theory of the firm, complex systems, etc. Unfortunately, the Wikipedia's rabbit hole haven't really helped settling my mind's inquiry.

To be more specific, some of my questions about these entities are:

* How do they come to be? At some point they're just a bunch of people wanting to accomplish something and then, somehow, they become this thing that has its own set of values, independent of the people that work in it.
* How they maintain or change these values through time?
* Is there some pattern in their structure?
* What role does Law have in then? It seems to have great importance.

AskSocialScience,"I was recently doing some personal research on homosexual heritability studies and came across a review of a book by Neil Whitehead, a supposed doctor with questionable credentials, which purported that genetic and prenatal factors had minimal influence on wether someone was gay or not.

At the beginning they make a point of saying that,

&gt; ""One study cited showed that 84 percent of homosexual men said that their fathers were indifferent to them. This was compared to only 10 percent of the heterosexual men studied. Lesbians have poorer relationships with their mothers than heterosexual woman. There is also a correlation in both with early sexual abuse.

This seems to be a prevalent talking point among conversion therapy supporters, and I was wondering how that statistic is reached.

They also talk about twin studies,

&gt;What about identical twin studies? Do they offer proof that homosexuality is genetic? Studies have shown that when one identical twin is homosexual then the other twin has a 50% change of being homosexual. But to offer proof the chance should be 100%, since all the DNA which the twins inherit is identical. The rules for scientifically valid twin study analysis have seven requirements which in practical terms are impossible to meet.   
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, twins are not identical to the general population as they have a much higher rate of child abuse than non-twins as well as other differences which could make a difference in statistical results. The rate of homosexuality itself is higher in twins. In any event, the Whiteheads believe that a ""50% heritability"" doesn't mean much since other twin studies have shown that religiosity is also at the 50% level, as is altruism and fundamentalism. Even divorce is at a 52% level. These characteristics, we know, are not genetically determined. The concordance for lesbianism is much less. So homosexuality is not destined for the other twin even if one is homosexual.

They also discussed research from [Clellan S. Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clellan_S._Ford) and [Frank A. Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Beach) that stated that ""In twenty-nine of seventy-nine culture surveys... homosexuality was rare or absent."" Part of me believes this may be in part due to different attitudes about sexuality making gay or lesbian people less visible, but that's just speculation.

Now, all that being said, Whitehead's qualifications are again, questionable, and he does not seem to have the support he claims he does among the psychological and academic communities. So what is the truth behind the statistics he cites?","How much do parenting, genetics, or culture have to do with homosexuality?",[deleted]

AskSocialScience,"Edit: I came to realize this question is hard to answer with specific research, and here's a little more background as to why I asked it:

Under the knowledge that high school students (early to late adolescence) vastly face developmental challenges such as social comparison, body image, and self-evaluation it's strange that these tv shows/movies subject an already vulnerable audience to their created portrayal of settings/characters. Role-modeling can be a double-edged sword. There's other options (e.g. university) that may be more developmentally appropriate and in-line with actions and behaviors that occur in these productions.

At the end of the day entertainment calls for levels of altered realism, which I understand. In terms of universality, high school is experienced more than college. High school settings tend to be the standard, which I'm not for nor against, but when I think about the social and psychological implications I tend to wonder why it is.","Why do so many tv series and movies take place in a high school setting rather than university despite the adult-level drama, plots, and storylines?",TraderOats

AskSocialScience,"So yesterday I was sitting with two of my roommates, Tim and Tammy, in our kitchen and for whatever reason I can't remember cultural appropriation was brought up. 

My stance on this subject was always that I genuinely never understood it and deemed it as a stupid concept, but I am not too educated on the subject whereas my roommates both are, atleast a lot more than me. 
Naturally we engaged in a discussion, because they wanted to explain and change my view. 

The main example we were talking about was braids. Tammy told me that braids are a thing that was brought into life by black people and that slaves used to hide food in their braids or other items. 
Because of this reason it is beyond unacceptable if white people were to get braids, as they never experienced such things and most don't even know about the meaning behind them. Both of them said that it's simply nothing that you get for the aesthetic only and that doing so would be ignorant. 


I don't understand this point for this reason: Braids have this origin, yes, but for example afro-american youth has never experienced slavery. In my opinion they don't have more of a connection to braids than caucasians that live today. Perhaps this is a wrong viewpoint, but that's why I am here looking to find answers. 

I told them this exact thing and they both responded that even though black youth has never experienced slavery, they still suffer from it's effects on the society, a point I wholeheartedly agree with. But what does that have to do with the topic? 

If braids were used the way Tammy described and people don't do it now, atleast young black people in the western world (by that I mean maybe people in other parts of the world still have them for this very reason ), what's the difference? Or to put it like this: If braids was a hairstyle of slaves and thus part of slave-culture (in the sense that slaves have had their very own culture, like the music genre Blues could be identified as part of slaves culture) then according to the logic of cultural appropriation shouldn't only slaves be allowed to wear braids, because everything else is disrespectful? 

I hope you guys understand what I mean, this is such a complicated issue and it's hard to explain my thoughts perfectly in a foreign language. 

Anyways, our discussion led to nowhere, however I told them I'd try to further learn about this issue and thus spend a couple of hours on this topic today. This sadly didn't really help, as most arguments genuinely didn't make sense to me. 

The strongest argument I encountered was that cultural appropriation is so bad because it kind of devalues the symbolism behind the appropriated thing and thus is damaging to the culture. 

However after thinking about it, I found myself completely disagreeing with it for two reasons:

1) If for example you see a caucasian dude with rastas, you see just that. You have no idea whether or not this person actually is a practicing rastafarian. Not a single person in the world knows unless you directly approach this person. So how does it devalue the symbolism when you have no chance of knowing for what reason a person wears rastas? 

2) In the circumstance that you approach the dude and ask him about the rastas and he really only has them for aesthetic reasons, how does it change the meaning of rastas? I mean if you're a practicing rastafarian and meet someone with rastas who isn't a practicing rastafarian, why does that devalue the symbol in your eyes? I genuinely don't understand. The symbol still has the same meaning in your religion and will always have that meaning, nobody can change that. 

I mean look at the cross for example. It's used on so many things these days, people get it tattooed for aesthetic reasons, yet it hasn't lost it's meaning for the christians. 

Again, I have very little knowledge on this topic and maybe tackle the issue from an completely wrong viewpoint, but I always followed the principle to generally rate someone's actions and behavior based on their intentions. 

If you get dreadlocks because you appreciate them and like how they look, in my eyes you're golden. 
Once you however do things to explicitly disrespect or mock something of a different culture, you're a cunt. 

I feel like people choose to be offended, whereas another perspective could be to understand that imitation is the highest from of flattery. Isn't it a good thing if someone sees something from a different culture and likes so much that he adopts it?

They document many studies on the topic of institutional/systemic racism and its existence. 

I've looked through several of these studies, and they seem to make a compelling case there are racial differences in how individuals are treated within systems like the justice system, education, etc. 

I am excited to hear feedback on either of these two documents. Some common criticism I hear is that these documents don't consider other races. For example, what if Asian people got shorter sentences than white?
To that I usually say, yes we'd need studies to confirm that, and if that exists, its wrong. But for now, we have definite proof that racism of black people as compared to white people exists, and that's a problem. Are there any studies that are more comprehensive or multivariate I should add to my arsenal? Are there studies I should eliminate due to weakness?

AskSocialScience,"Hi everyone! I'm not a social sciences researcher, so my apologies if I'm talking about anything in the wrong way or if I'm simply asking the wrong questions, but I'm hoping that by narrowing the scope of my questions to a particular study it will help guide my questions and the answers a little bit more explicitly. 

For some background, my friends and I have been having back and forth arguments about [this study (Kang, et al, 2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298795100_Whitened_Resumes_Race_and_Self-Presentation_in_the_Labor_Market) for a while now. Specifically, the data collection and presentation in ""Experiment 3"" of this resume study. 

The study, in short, is looking at the impacts of ""whitening"" resumes on a POC's callback rate. Things like obscuring an African American or Asian name with initials or a similar ""white-sounding"" name, changing out ""African American Business Leaders"" with ""Business Leaders"" for clubs and activities, etc. We can't seem to get to the bottom of it or have a productive discussion about the findings because some of my friends doubt the validity of the methods/sample sizes. 

After long hours of heated debate, I think we've gotten down to the crux of it that I can try to simplify into a single question: is the sample size sufficiently large enough to account for the uncontrollable variables in this study's methods and if so, how can we determine this to be the case? I have a few questions for you all to help guide me, so I hope you can help.

1. Is it typical in social sciences to not include a section saying ""here's what our sample size is and here's *why* it is significant/sufficient to account for uncontrollable factors.""? 

2. Is there a way that I, as a lay person, can determine that for myself in studies that don't include that sort of section?

3. If there is a way to do #2 with this study, how would I go about doing that? Is there a standard or preferred method or is it on a case-by-case basis? 

4. Are there any other pieces of analysis that I ought to do when looking at studies like these to better understand how ""strong"" the data/study is at a methodological level? 

I'd really like to be a piece of the puzzle for my friends/colleagues and help push these sorts of conversations forward in a grounded way. They tend to devolve into these awful ""well the study doesn't account for this, so we don't know if there's a better explanation than what you're proposing"" types of back and forth nit-picking arguments, and they get stale, and heated really quickly. I think most of it is borne out of our collective ignorance within the social sciences and research in general that makes it impossible for us to get to that next step of discussion.

AskSocialScience,"Hello,

Critical Race Theory and associated constructs have recently come under fire after Donald Trump's recent condemnations. The reactions have been mixed, as to some, Critical Race Theory represents a sort of atheoretical dogma that is beyond reproach for certain populations in society (i.e. ""white people""). 

White Fragility is a book that is commonly referenced as evidence of this dogma and recently I have encountered accusations that it is evidence of the fraudulence of CRT. So there are several questions that I've been met with.

1. To what degree is White Fragility representative of Critical Race Theory?

2. Does ""White Fragility"" suggest that White people are incapable of critiquing Critical Race Theory?

3. Does ""White Fragility"" suggest that White people (as opposed to the construct of identity) are inherently racist (based on the laymen's definition that suggests racism represents racial animus/illogic)?

AskSocialScience," It seems to me that to be able to participate in the arts and humanities,  one must be able to meet conditions such as the quality of education in  one's environment, how supportive is the environment to the pursuit of  wanting to engage in those fields (either academically or  non-academically), and whether or not they have access to knowledge of  such subjects themselves in general.

An  example of this would be the fact that a large majority of people in  the art industry that work on animation (i.e. storyboard artists,  background painters, etc.) tend to be middle-upper class cosmopolitan  urbanites. To able to pursue such careers (much less considering  pursuing such careers in the first place), I think, requires some degree  of societal privilege. Another example that comes to mind would be to  contemplate on how there may be thousands of extremely great artists and  writers out there that lack the means to distribute their work due to  societal conditions.

What I'm  interested in is how does this system of exclusion caused by inequality  of opportunity influence such subjects overall. So far the only  philosophical work I'm familiar with that somewhat touches on this is  Foucault's idea of genealogy/archeology that has some sort of a basis on  viewing history for a lens of exclusion and marginality, Beauvoir's  views on subjugation in The Second Sex, and Gramsci's work on cultural  hegemony.

AskSocialScience,"Social media and news media have been painting an extremely dark picture of the world as of late, America in particular.  The picture is so dark, in fact, that I feel increasingly worried that there a breakdown in American democracy is imminent, if it isn't already here.  However, considering how these sources inflate or exaggerate issues, favoring emotional punch over nuance, I wanted to get the perspective of people who would probably be better able to assess the situation.  These are the subjects which have most recently given me cause for concern:

* The border detention camps appear to be precursors to concentration camps, if they aren't concentration camps already.  They way they are operated, and the people staffing them, appear to be distillations of sadistic cruelty.

* Police brutality has been an ever-present issue in America, but as far as I'm aware it's only recently come into mainstream attention.  However, attempts to rectify the issue seem to have only [escalated the brutality](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/police-violence-protests-us-george-floyd).  The deployment of federal troops in protesting cities seems to have been a continuation and escalation of this issue.

* The severe—and increasing—wealth inequality, and corresponding concentration of power into ever-more powerful oligopolies.  This seems to present two dangers:  one of revolution, and one of economic collapse.  In the past, severe wealth inequality has been a contributing factor of revolutions as disenfranchised people finally get fed up.  Even if we aren't in danger of such a revolution, though, it seems that the economy is an increasingly top-heavy Jenga tower with only a few rotting pegs to hold the entire thing up.  If the poorest people get much poorer, or occupy a larger proportion of the population, I find it hard to imagine how the economy could continue to function.

* Polarization and media bubbles.  It seems that the country is split into two halves operating off of fundamentally different and increasingly contradictory axioms and values.  Two incompatible subcultures within America seems to be a guarantee of long-term instability.

* The American government's gross mishandling of the pandemic, and the decisions of large segments of the population to practically ignore it.  This seems to have mostly highlighted the cracks in American democracy, but also to have deepened them and produced significant short-term instability.

* Corruption, cronyism, and abuse of power throughout the government.  Older issues and concerns of mine which suggest long-term instability include gerrymandering, and media bubbles/polarization.  An example that come to mind is President Trump's continuous obstructions and derailment of investigations against him.  More recently I've become concerned about oligopolies wielding seemingly absolute power over politicians and the political process—as with [Robert Duncan serving a Mitch McConnell super-PAC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/usps-chair-robert-duncan-is-director-for-mcconnell-linked-super-pac.html).  It feels as though the damage to the country's institutions is irreparable, and that the democratic decay runs so deep as to be incurable.

* [Russian interference with American elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials) and the apparent eagerness of American officials to let them—[*help*] them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/us/politics/senate-intelligence-russian-interference-report.html)—do it.  At the very least, America is vulnerable to foreign interference, at worst, a handful of Americans have given the reigns of the political process to a foreign power for their own personal gain.  In either case, America and its institutions lose autonomy and seem to be pushed down a path meant to weaken and destabilize.

Many warning signs of a collapse that I learned from history classes appear to be present:  inequality, corruption, rising authoritarianism, consolidation of power, and large segments of the population feeling as though they've lost both their dignity and way of life.

First, all major movies released in this time-frame feature this plot ,e.g most Marvel superhero movies ,Star Wars etc. But as I said TV or Online commercials started to feature this plot too.

AskSocialScience,"I notice that within psychology, and adjacent fields such as behavioral biology, causal explanations of behavior often confound the evolutionary purpose and the psychological motive behind behavior. 

To give an example: ""Male lions kill the offspring of other males so that they can have more offspring themselves.""

In reality, a lion is not interested in increasing the number of descendants it produces. The psychological motive of the lion may be to have lionesses going into heat earlier again, since mating is likely a rewarding activity. This is assuming the lion even understands the connection between killing offspring and mating opprtunities which arise at a later point in time. 

It seems like this lack of differentiation also leads to the compulsive search for the evolutionary purpose of any observed behavior, be it in animals or humans. Examples which come to mind are attempts to explain suicide in humans. I suppose it can not be categorically ruled out that suicide serves an evolutionary purpose, however, the evolutionary explanations of suicide I have encountered seem rather implausible to me. It seems much more likely that suicide is a non-adaptive byproduct of the complex nature of human thought and behavior than a reproductive advantage.

If we acknowledge that psychological motives serve as a degree of seperation between observed behavior and evolutionary selectional forces, it becomes obvious that some behaviors are simply not adaptive in terms of reproductive fitness, but rather random byproducts of behavior. 

 **My question:** Are there theories/articles which expand on this line of thought?

AskSocialScience,"Hi,

not quite sure whether this is a proper subreddit for asking this question but I think it might be a concept that has been described in social sciences. So here it goes:

I have repeatedly observed that some guideline / ruleset / method as described in literature is **wrongfully** applied. By that I mean certain provisions are followed to the letter, others aren't and what you get is an implementation of the guidelines that doesn't quite match the guidelines as specified.

So basically when you discuss whether ""guideline X"" is a valuable method worth implementing, this is a repeated pattern.

* some say its good
* others provide examples of instances where people didn't feel like it was valuable
* Proponents blame the implementors, as being responsible for the trouble because the implementors wouldn't follow the guideline truthfully / exact
* opponents blame the method for being systematically hard to implement / follow.

AskSocialScience,"The theory goes like this, evolution favours characteristics that promote the survival of the given  species right? And we have desire to seek out these characteristics in friends or partners because that maximises our own chances of survival and our children's. 

We watch TV because that gives us knowledge that we can use in social situations which is a form of power that would have been useful in early humans to help us survive ( the ability to influence and lead others), we go to the gym because that gives us physical power over other men, we aspire to high level careers because that gives us social and economic power.  So the question is, why did evolution favour a species that looks for power in so many different places? My answer :power = sex, and sex= the survival of the human race, and even if that's not something you think about, or something you want,  the unconscious mind leads you towards it like squirrels hibernating. 

Now some humans don't want to have sex, this doesn't mess up my theory because sex= the survival of the human race, and using power there are other ways to do this, that's why we feel good when we give to the homeless, or help a stranger on the street. Those who are asexual as it were, still do everything because of prolonging humanity, just in a different way.

In my opinion this leads to the conclusion that humans are naturally collective,  because socialisation leads different people to look for power in different places, and any one of these forms of power are useless on their own, what's strength with out intellect? What's ingenuity without the ability to lead? So we need all of our forms of power together to survive.

Let’s say there are two substitute goods in a market,CocaCola and Pepsi. According to theory in which I learned when the price of let’s say Coca Cola rises from 5$ to 10$, then the quantity demanded decreases . And there is a shift to the demand curve of Pepsi to the right, because it appears cheaper , which will lead to Pepsi price rise from 5$ to 7.5$ . My question is why would those people who buy cola still prefer buying it if it’s higher priced, cause I assumed it’s Ceterus Paribus and we don’t assume factors like consumer preferences where a consumer like cola more than Pepsi . 

Additionally this is a bit off topic but what exactly is a market price . I understand it’s determined by the supply and demand in the market , however there are different suppliers in the market like for t shirts someone might sell at a higher price and someone sell at a cheaper price , how can there be one market price though.
Like in the above example is market price 7.5 or 10?

- Producer surplus : I am a bit unclear about producer surplus . Is producer surplus the difference in price a producer is willing to accept for the good compared to the market price. So in this statement if I imagine the supply curve for the market , and below the market price level and above the supply curve I shade the producer surplus . But at the market price each producer who was willing to supply at a lower price will increase its individual quantity supplied at a point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost , so at that quantity while selling it why would they accept a lower price , how are they still in surplus?

Whenever there are shifts in the supply / demand curves, for me it get's very confusing because I overthink the movements along the curve. 

Like for example a good is priced at $14 and the tax is $6. Is it that the producer continues to produce the quanity of good at his original price at $14 and due to tax charges $20. Then assuming elastic demand, demand decreases to some x value, then he receives a signal, and then over time he reduces prices and production until new equilbrium price. Or when he receives the news of a new  tax of $6, he only raises the price a little bit perhaps to $15 and reduces production to new equilbrium point. I hope you guys understand the question I am asking, because I understand tax incidence and all when it's inelastic and elastic demand, my main question is Does the supplier knowing there is elastic demand :

a) decreases production to new equilbrium point (more like a jump from intial equilbrium point to another)

People are generally bad at making an explicit connection between the value of something and the price they are willing to pay for it. Decision making when making purchases is done at the margins rather than on values in a vacuum, i.e. the price I'm willing to pay for a hamburger depends a lot on the varieties and prices of hamburgers that I have access to. I've seen anecdotes and truisms from marketing circles claiming that most people pick the second-cheapest or second most-expensive item from the choices on hand simply because they don't want to fall to either extreme.

Are those concepts applicable to areas like political science, ideology, and candidate choice?

What is the role of social sciences given the lack of predictability in these fields?

Current political scientists feel, in the public eye, fairly useless these days. Given their lack of predictive powers, as seen in the 2016 election, the black box that is modern day economics, and ambiguity on the most simple (but not easy) questions in the the public sphere (“how can we change race relations?”), what is the role of social sciences?

Of course, those dealing with a scientific approach to these questions have to deal with far more factors than someone like an engineer. When calculating the trajectory of a rocket, one can estimate thrust, lift, drag, air resistance, create a model and have a definite result. With the trajectory of an election, one has to quantify political scandals, the impact of social media, unexpected barriers to the voting process. It is far more complicated by the nature of the question, and essentially impossible to answer qualitative questions in a satisfactory quantitative or binary way.

Any reading on the topic would be really welcome as well! Thank you for reading.


reply to deleted comment which elaborated a bit more of my train of thought, correctly saying I mischaracterized what science is:

I guess I am talking about public perception of science as being primarily quantitatively based. However given the change in tools used to analyze the most impactful changes in society that social science addresses, I suppose this is also what I am more interested in.

I guess an example of my line of thinking is the past twenty years of behavioral economics (a very “sexy” topic these days). It seems as though the most interesting spheres where this is being studied in successfully predictive ways is not in academic settings at all, rather via private companies like Facebook determining what color of blue or what pages you are likely to interact with.

More and more frequently academic spheres seem to correctly acknowledge a lack of predictability, for example when Danny Kahneman was asked how his research on decision making lead him personally to better decisions, he replied that he didn’t believe it did at all.

AskSocialScience,"Lots of countries had slaves, including much of the Americas. But slavery has not lead to the racial issues in those other countries  post-emancipation, that we have had in America in the century and a half since the Civil War (If there are exceptions I'm ignorant of, feel free to point them out).

Why? I can think of several thesis:

Pure demographics - If African-Americans had been double the percentage of American the population they actually are, then they would have had more power, and things here would have looked a lot more like, say, Brazil.

The fact that we fought an especially bloody Civil War over the issue.

The specific power of states' rights and state laws in the USA

The failure of reconstruction under Andrew Jackson and beyond

Specific oppressive laws

Other things specific to America - Economic, geographic, etc.

So, my question is: Is one or more of those things considered more primary? For example, if the demographics were as I suggested, does that change everything in the most significant way? Are other things more secondary, and the result of larger main issues?

I'm visiting my dad's side of family and see the book ""Civilisation and its Discontents"" on my stepsister's table. I'm delighted to discover that she shares the same interest in social sciences as I do, but I don't think this book is a great introductory text to any field.  
  
Aside from it being possibly a hard read, it's written from a period where methodologies were not as developed as today. Also we're from China. Schools don't teach critical thinking. A high schooler may very likely take what's in a book as ""the truth"". I also think the activity of reading books without knowing some context can do some harms. For example, if a highschooler in China encounters a misogynist point of view in a book written by an authoritive figure, they might take it at its face value. Whereas if they know the book was written in a period where misogyny was rampant, they could take some distance from the point of view.    

Obviously I don't want to destroy her interest by commenting on her choice, so I'm hoping to recommend some books for her that are interesting, have less biases and more scientific rigour. It could be from any field, she doesn't know what to study in University so I'm hoping to help her discover some choices. It should be preferably not a theoretical text, but focus on one or more concrete questions, provides some context in the field and applies modern methodologies in its investigation. In this way she can be gently introduced the concepts and theories while they're being applied. Ideally the book should be somewhat popular so that there could be a translation.

AskSocialScience,"In my Brazilian context, what would be called the ''traditional'' right is a very ardent economic neoliberalism that is accompanied by mild social conservatism. The formula of the alt-right is inverted with economic isolation and strong emphasis on social morals.  It is usually accompanied by populism, restrictions on civil liberties and militarism. Most importantly, the alt-right defines itself as against the establishment and the traditional right's economic policy and thought is more directly dependent on academia. I think we all know what I am talking about but I clarify anyway for the purposes of allowing discussion.              

I have numerous hypothesis, which I seek confirmation or invalidation, one of them is that this is an extension of the Cold War and associated with the Balkans.    

 The soviet occupation, ethnic rivalries and conflict with people of Ottoman descent created a powerful cocktail of anticommunism, anti-islamism, elements of racism and authoritarian rule in that region. The war against terrorism promoted by the USA in my mind gave these ideas strength in the public sphere and soon infected the entirety of Eastern Europe. Russia, already an illiberal wannabe superpower, served as a vehicle through which these ideas could be exported through the wider world from their close relations with south slavs. Poland, which repugnates Russia, was still a hotstop of ethnic nationalism so it did not serve as a buffer zone.               

Thus, the US became illiberal facing the threat of terrorism, while Russia and Eastern Europe were already illiberal. The role of China is uncertain in all this. They have limited influence in Southeast Asia because of their imperialistic past and even less in India. While Central Asia is more prone to influence, Russia is already a key ideological influencer. 

I'm also reminded of Gaddafi. In many ways he promoted a kind of ''alt-left'' that took elements of nationality and religion that would be despiced by soviets and put them on the center of his doctrine. Could it be that the alt-right takes his principles of anti-western resistance and apply them to the west itself? How did that happen?
