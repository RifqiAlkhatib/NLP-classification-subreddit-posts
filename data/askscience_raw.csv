This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hwnhe2/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.

Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:** CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 97)!

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ Vic Leverett OBE: 40 years' engineering experience with previous director-level positions Europe's largest defence/engineering companies. Honoured by The Queen with an OBE for services to engineering and defence.
+ Professor David Humber: 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.
+ David Whyte: Technologist and Chartered Engineer with 10 years' Research and Deployment experience and 15 international patents across a wide range of technologies.
+ Amy Knight: Science teacher and artist experienced in art/science collaborations with organisations like Soapbox Science and The Royal Society; her work has been featured at the Tate Modern's ""Tate Exchange"".
+ Anthony McQuiggan: 10 years of engineering experience and 30 years as a serial entrepreneur having built a number of very successful start-up SME technology companies in the UK, Japan and the USA.
+ Roger Pittock: 36 years' experience in electronics, software, mechanical, electrical, process engineering, and safety systems. Avid supporter of the Consumers' Association, currently serving on their Council.
+ Adam Wood - President of CSES: Chartered Engineer with over 12 years' experience in electronics, software and systems engineering, working in the medical / healthcare, transport and aerospace industries.

Grab a slice of celebratory pie and post your questions about Pi, mathematics in general, or even the history of Pi. Our team of panelists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

**What intrigues you about pi? Our experts are here to answer your questions.** Pi has enthralled humanity with questions like:

- How do we know pi is [never-ending and non-repeating](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/maths/pi_irrational)?

- Would pi still be irrational in [number systems that aren't base 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/maths/pi_base10)?

- How can an irrational number represent a real-world relationship like that [between a circumference and diameter](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/maths/pi_irrational_real_world)?

,askscience,"Obviously planets orbit the sun on nearly perfect keplerian orbits, I'm not questioning that. My question is in the fine details:

There's something that was bugging me about orbital mechanics with 3+ bodies: for instance, the ISS is orbiting the Earth in a nice round orbit around its center of mass: but the Moon is also orbiting the Earth in such a way that their barycenter is offset by a good 3000km. Obviously the Moon also pulls on the ISS, but somehow it doesn't seem to affect the point it orbits around. On the other hand, an object orbiting around a close binary system will orbit their center of mass, and not either of the two, which is the opposite result.

Of course those are extreme cases, but they made me raise the question of less extreme ones: Jupiter offsets the solar system's center so much it can come out of the Sun. Does Saturn orbit that point, or does it orbit the Sun still? What about Mars, or the asteroid belt? **Is there a way to know which point of space an object can be best said to orbit?**

My intuition would tell me that the equivalent mass that governs the shape and speed of the orbit is one at the center of mass of all bodies **within** that orbit (eg the Sun + all inner planets and objects), with no net change to that from outer objects, which is the best way I could think of to reconcile the two extreme cases and it also seems coherent with Gauss' law. Is that inuition correct?

For instance, I'd see Mercury as orbiting the Sun, with not net influence from any other object apart from perturbations. But does the orbit of Venus accelerate in such a way that it's as if the mass of Mercury was added to that of the Sun? In other words, is it more correct to consider Mercury as simply perturbing Venus' orbit around the Sun, or as increasing the effective mass and position of the Sun by its own mass, or perhaps by a different amount depending on how close it is to the orbit of Venus? Or am I completely wrong going down this track?

Among the observations that scientists have been making, there is that such statistics does not show anomalies as thrombosis happens on an even higher frequency regardless.

,askscience,"I apologize if this question has already been asked, i could not find any threads or concrete answers about this (or maybe i just didn't understand them :).

So, i've been reading about the mechanism of the new Adenoviral vector vaccines (AZ, J&amp;J, etc). From all explanations i've read, this is my (very simplistic) understanding:

1. Modified adenovirus enters the cell
2. DNA is injected in the nucleus
3. mRNA is ""generated"" and exits the nucleus
4. Cell starts producing and expressing spike protein
5. Immune response is provoked

What i'm wondering is, basically, what exactly happens with the cell after that:

Does the viral DNA degrade at some point?

Once this DNA is in the cell's nucleus, for how long is step 3 executed?

Since those vaccines are administered in the muscle, i'm guessing it's exactly the muscle cells that get 'infected' and start expressing the spike protein.  And from a very quick search, it seems that the lifetime of a muscle cell is 10-15 years. 

I guess a bonus question would be, once the cell expresses the spike protein, does the immune system kill it or persistently continues trying to?

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a question within these topics you weren&amp;#39;t sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt; post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &amp;quot;What would happen if...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How will the future...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If all the rules for &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; were different...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why does my...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.&lt;/p&gt;

,askscience,"Hi Reddit! We just published a study on live two-way communication with lucid dreamers - [watch VIDEO of the experiment here](https://youtu.be/7M06fJxiayo?t=501). AUA!

Hi! My name is Karen Konkoly and I'm a third-year PhD student in Ken Paller's cognitive neuroscience lab at Northwestern University. My projects focus on lucid dreaming and how it can be used to learn more about sleep, dreams, and consciousness more broadly.  I've been studying lucid dreaming for 7 years - since my sophomore year of college - when I attended an 8-day lucid dreaming retreat in Hawaii to garner ideas for my undergraduate senior thesis. (I subsequently concluded that the research was awesome.) The following summer, I worked at Brown University as a William E. Dement sleep research apprentice, and I gave a TEDx talk on lucid dreaming that fall. In my senior thesis, I taught participants to lucid dream in a month-long course, and I found that participants tended to feel less stressed and more vigorous the day after they had a lucid dream. After graduating from Lehigh, I interned at the Neuroscience and Psychology of Sleep lab at Cardiff University in Wales, assisting with an overnight project on presenting sounds during REM sleep. While in Wales, I also collaborated with researchers at nearby Swansea University to develop a new method of inducing lucid dreams. This method, dubbed Targeted Lucidity Reactivation, was able to induce lucid dreams in half of the participants in a single nap session. Now at Northwestern, I'm testing new methods and applications for communicating with dreamers.

Hi there, Reddit! I'm Ken Paller, a Professor at Northwestern University, where I hold the James Padilla Chair in Arts &amp; Sciences and serve as director of the training program in the neuroscience of human cognition. I'm a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, a Senior Fellow of the Mind and Life Institute, and was awarded the Senator Mark Hatfield Award from the Alzheimer's Association. My research has focused on human memory and consciousness - using a variety of methods including electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging - and my findings have contributed to understanding features of conscious memory experiences as well as ways in which memory operations differ in the absence of awareness of memory retrieval, as in implicit-memory priming, intuition, and implicit social bias. I've published nearly 200 scientific articles, reviews, and book chapters, some of which you can find on [my lab website](https://pallerlab.psych.northwestern.edu/). Some of my research has concerned patients with memory disorders, including evidence linking memory deficits to poor sleep. Recent studies from my lab showed that memory processing during sleep can reinforce prior learning, providing novel evidence on sleep's role in memory.

Our [most recent paper](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00059-2) described innovative research on two-way communication during REM sleep. We demonstrated the feasibility of real-time dialogue between an experimenter and someone in the midst of a lucid dream. Experimenters asked questions for which the correct answer was known so that we could determine whether effective communication was achieved. When dreamers responded, their answers were given via eye movements or facial muscle twitches - and they were usually correct. The first successful two-way communication during sleep was achieved in the lab in the early morning of January 9th, 2019. Karen gave Christopher Mazurek, a research participant and now a member of the lab group, the math problem 8 minus 6, which Christopher answered correctly. (At the time, we were unaware of similar studies in Germany by Kris Appel and in France by Delphine Oudiette and colleagues. Later, we decided to publish our results together.) Further applications of this method, which NOVA PBS captured for the first time on film in a [digital documentary on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M06fJxiayo) and [wrote about in an article](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/lucid-dreaming-communication/), can now probe conscious dream experiences as they happen, and who knows what else!

We're looking forward to today - we'll be on at 4:00 p.m. EST (21 UT), AUA!

I&amp;#39;ve published nearly 200 scientific articles, reviews, and book chapters, some of which you can find on &lt;a href=""https://pallerlab.psych.northwestern.edu/""&gt;my lab website&lt;/a&gt;. Some of my research has concerned patients with memory disorders, including evidence linking memory deficits to poor sleep. Recent studies from my lab showed that memory processing during sleep can reinforce prior learning, providing novel evidence on sleep&amp;#39;s role in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=""https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21""&gt;most recent paper&lt;/a&gt;00059-2) described innovative research on two-way communication during REM sleep. We demonstrated the feasibility of real-time dialogue between an experimenter and someone in the midst of a lucid dream. Experimenters asked questions for which the correct answer was known so that we could determine whether effective communication was achieved. When dreamers responded, their answers were given via eye movements or facial muscle twitches - and they were usually correct. The first successful two-way communication during sleep was achieved in the lab in the early morning of January 9th, 2019. Karen gave Christopher Mazurek, a research participant and now a member of the lab group, the math problem 8 minus 6, which Christopher answered correctly. (At the time, we were unaware of similar studies in Germany by Kris Appel and in France by Delphine Oudiette and colleagues. Later, we decided to publish our results together.) Further applications of this method, which NOVA PBS captured for the first time on film in a &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M06fJxiayo""&gt;digital documentary on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/lucid-dreaming-communication/""&gt;wrote about in an article&lt;/a&gt;, can now probe conscious dream experiences as they happen, and who knows what else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re looking forward to today - we&amp;#39;ll be on at 4:00 p.m. EST (21 UT), AUA!&lt;/p&gt;

,askscience,"Hello all,

I'm having a hard time trying to make sense of the mechanism of the Na+/K+ pump. So what I know is that there is a higher concentration of K+ in the interior of cell and oppositely the interior has a a lower concentration of Na+. So naturally, K+ ion will want to move outside of the cell and Na+ ions will want to move inside. However, the Na+/K+ pump moves Na+ and K+ ions against their ""wills"". I'm vaguely aware that this is an active transport meaning ATP is required to carry it out but I'm not sure why such energy  must be used for this. Why not just let them move according to their concentration gradients? 

I was trying to explain this to myself and I thought about the fact that the interior of cell is electrically negative as compared to the extracellular fluid. This one I'm not sure what it means. Does being electrically negative mean that in total there are move negative charges inside the cell than outside? If so, cell would try to direct more positive charges towards the inside. That might be why 2 K+ ions are moved in. However, it doesn't make sense as 3 K+ ions are pumped out. So in total there's a net loss of positive ions inside the cell? Also Does being electrically negative mean that in total there are move negative charges inside the cell than outside? I'm very confused by this.

In summary, I would like to ask 3 questions 

1. Why does the Na+/K+ pump move Na+ and K+ against their concentration gradient? 
2. Does the interior of the cell being electrically negative mean that in total there are move negative charges inside the cell than outside?
3. why is the ratio of Na+ out vs K+ in 3:2?

I am deeply appreciative of all the helps I can get. I've been tossing and turning all night trying to make sense of this but to no avail. Also I've just started learning about membranes and action potentials a few days ago so simple explanations are much encouraged.

Say a rocket moves away from Earth at 99% the speed of light and I then shine a laser towards that rocket. Once that laser catches up to the rocket, will it be observed to travel at 1% the speed of light since we are already moving at 99% the speed? I understand that the speed of light remains constant for everyone but if we observe it to travel at 100% the speed of light from the rocket, doesn't that mean that it is technically moving faster than the speed of light?

,askscience,"Hi! I am Tel Aviv University cancer biologist, Prof. Neta Erez. I study the tumor metastasis microenvironment.

Tumors are more than just a bunch of cancer cells. They are better described as multicellular organisms. In each tumor there are complex interactions with immune cells, which cause inflammation processes in the connective tissue and blood vessels.

In my lab, we study these interactions to understand how tumor cells ""hijack"" physiological pathways and use them to support their growth. Additionally, we also study the link between cancer and inflammation,specifically how cancer cells metastasize and grow in distant organs from their original host.

Prof. Erez studies the biology of tumor metastasis, focusing on the metastatic microenvironment, cancer-related inflammation and the role of stromal and immune cells in facilitating the early and late stages of metastasis. Prof. Erez's work focuses on these crucial aspects of cancer. She uses mouse models of carcinogenesis and metastasis of melanoma, breast, and ovarian carcinoma. The main goal of her research is to identify and characterize key molecular pathways in the communication between tumor cells and their microenvironment that can be targeted by novel therapeutics.

Prof. Erez began her academic career at the Weizmann Institute of Science. She obtained her PhD in the field of molecular cell biology under the guidance of Prof. Varda Rotter.  Supported by a fellowship from the Cancer Research Institute (CRI), Prof. Erez carried out her postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Prof. Doug Hanahan at UCSF, working in the field of tumor biology (2005-2010). During her postdoctoral fellowship she demonstrated a novel role for cancer-associated fibroblasts in mediating tumor-promoting inflammation. Following her postdoctoral work, she joined the Department of Pathology at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in October 2010, and currently serves as the Department Chair.

,askscience,"Hi Reddit! I'm Herman Pontzer, PhD, Associate Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and Associate Research Professor of Global Health at the Duke Global Health Institute. I conduct research on the human metabolism through studies with hunter-gatherer tribes like the Hadza in Africa.

In my decade of study in this field, what I've learned challenges the consensus of the diet and exercise industry. We've always been told that exercise increases the number of calories we burn each day, but a [doubly labeled water study with the Hadza](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040503) conducted by me and my research team shows that our bodies have evolved to adjust to our daily level of physical activity, thereby adjusting our metabolism to keep daily energy expenditure within a narrow range, regardless of how active we are. Instead, the key to losing weight and battling the obesity pandemic is regulating the number of calories we consume versus how many we burn. That's not to say we should abandon exercise - it is essential to keeping our bodies healthy and to aging well - but diet is the tool we need to focus on to manage our weight.

My new book, [*BURN*]( https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Research-Really-Calories-Healthy/dp/0525541527/), examines this exciting research taking place outside of traditional labs and reveals how a new understanding of our metabolism can inform our efforts to promote a healthy and sustainable society.

If you're curious about why we can't ""earn"" that slice of chocolate cake, whether a Paleo diet is actually ""Paleo,"" [what the Hadza can teach us about avoiding diseases of civilization like diabetes and obesity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12785), or what it's like to extract a live tick from your head while observing chimpanzees (true story), I am here for it.

Please excuse me if this is a dumb question, but:

During my studies, my textbook outlines that when a sex steroid (such as androgens) binds to a receptor, it creates a steroid-receptor complex that can bind to specific DNA sequences in chromatin, also known as steroid response elements (SREs). However, my textbook doesn’t highlight why a sex steroid would need to bind to DNA. 

What role does this play in the overall conformation of DNA?
Does the complex affect replication/transcription? And if yes, why would it need to do so? 
Does it affect hormonal levels/production within the body?

The equation (3/2)nkT = e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; /r gives a temperature of ~10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; K, but taking into account quantum tunneling and using the de Broglie wavelength as the radius of the nucleus, you can get a much lower temperature of ~10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; K. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty close to the temperatures observed in the corona. &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem""&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; even mentions that the corona is 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K and parts of it can reach even of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; K, though doesn&amp;#39;t have a source attached to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So does that mean that there are parts of the corona the can fuse hydrogen?

E^(2) = (PC)^(2) \+ (m\*C^(2))^(2)    (with E = energy, P = momentum, m = rest mass, and C = the speed of light)

One thing that stands out immediately is that it is the form of the pythagorean theorem. Namely,  that Energy is the hypotenuse and the sides are PC (momentum times the speed of light) and mC^(2) (the classic old E=mC^(2) energy.)  I know many physicists have a ""shut-up and calculate"" type of approach to these type of questions, but what does this relationship actually mean? Is there a commonly accepted interpretation of this? What does this imply about the world? To me this seems like a deep and interesting relationship, but I can't find anyone or anything really talking about it online aside from calling it ""Einstein's triangle"" or just pointing the relationship out.. The [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation) shows a [picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93momentum_relation#/media/File:Einstein-triangle-kinetic-energy.svg) which illustrates the relationship and calls it ""Einstein's Triangle"", but not really anything explaining what it actually means.

&amp;#x200B;

If I squint my eyes and handwave a bunch, to me it seems like PC is the spatial energy component and mC^(2) is the time energy component and since they are orthogonal they form a right triangle. But why is the total relativistic energy the hypotenuse?  I know one way of ""seeing"" relativity is that you and everything is always ""moving"" around at the speed of light, we just ""move"" more of our time energy and ""velocity"" to spatial dimensions. In which case, I could see a type of constant hypotenuse like relationship similar to if you are always walking around one step at a time, but just in different directions. The X and Y movements would change, but the hypotenuse is always one step.  However, I still don't see why that would imply energy as the hypotenuse?  Why can we look at this in a euclidean like way?

IDK, I may be rambling and not saying anything close to right here, but I am very curious about this.

I know one way of &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; relativity is that you and everything is always &amp;quot;moving&amp;quot; around at the speed of light, we just &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; more of our time energy and &amp;quot;velocity&amp;quot; to spatial dimensions. In which case, I could see a type of constant hypotenuse like relationship similar to if you are always walking around one step at a time, but just in different directions. The X and Y movements would change, but the hypotenuse is always one step.  However, I still don&amp;#39;t see why that would imply energy as the hypotenuse?  Why can we look at this in a euclidean like way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDK, I may be rambling and not saying anything close to right here, but I am very curious about this. It is bugging me and I am hoping someone can clarify this or at least point me to something I can read.  I may be missing something totally obvious, so go ahead and tell me why I am dumb, it would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

1. If radon is radioactive, and leaves radioactive material in your body, why does it mainly (only?) cause lung cancer?


2. If radon is 8x heavier than air, and mostly accumulates in the basement, wouldn't that mean that radon is a non-issue for people living on higher levels?


3. [This map](https://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/rhm/basic-info/1st/02-05-07.html) shows radon levels around the world. Why is radon so diverse across a small continent like Europe, yet wholly consistent across a massive country like Russia? Does it have to do with measuring limitations or architecture, or is the ground there weirdly uniform? 


4. If radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, why doesn't the  [map](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/28/10/1563.figures-only)of worldwide lung cancer cases coincide with the map of most radon heavy countries?  It seems to coincide wholly with countries that smoke heavily and nothing else. I base this one the fact that if you look at second chart, which is lung cancer incidence in females, the lung cancer cases in some countries like Russia, where smoking is much more prevalent among men, drop completely. Whereas lung cancer rates in scandinavia, far and away the most radon heavy place on earth, are not high to begin with.

Basically: does it take some time for an ovary to recover after a chemical pregnancy? Thus making it more likely you will ovulate off the opposite side in the cycle following the loss?

So backstory as to how I started wondering... I’m 27 and started my cycle at 9. Since I was 13, I’ve been able to feel my ovulation (Mittelschmerz). 

However it is almost always on my right side! I’ve also had two pregnancies with early scans that confirmed I had ovulated off the right side to conceive them. 

In December I had a chemical pregnancy. In January I felt unable to confirm ovulation (I don’t temp) because I did not feel that pain. I ended up with a positive test about a month after my chemical started. 

Now I’ve had an 8 week scan on that pregnancy and the tech told me I ovulated off my LEFT!!! perhaps that explains why I didn’t feel it?

,askscience," According to some interpretations of quantum mechanics – I'm not well-versed enough to know whether or not it's mainstream – the locus of entanglement is the entire universe, i.e. there is ultimately a universal wavefunction which describes the quantum state of the whole universe.

,askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Anthropology**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).

In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &amp;quot;What would happen if...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How will the future...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If all the rules for &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; were different...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why does my...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience""&gt;The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with &amp;#39;I think&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve heard&amp;#39;, then it&amp;#39;s not suitable for &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky""&gt;please refer to the information provided here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

- **Krista De Cooke, PhD student** (u/kdec940) studies the spread of invasive plants and native plant alternatives. Her work aims to develop practical tools to help people select appropriate plants for their needs that also serve a positive ecological purpose.

- **Stephanie Drumheller, PhD** (/u/uglyfossils) studies paleontology, especially taphonomy. Her research focuses on the processes of fossilization, evolution, and biology, of crocodiles and their relatives, including identifying bite marks on fossils. Find her on Twitter @UglyFossils.

- **Amy Luo, PhD student** (u/borb_watcher) is a behavioral ecologist studying the cultural evolution of bird song dialects. She is interested in the geographic distribution of cultural traits and interaction between cultural evolution and genetic evolution.

- **Brian O'Meara, PhD** (/u/omearabrian) is an evolutionary biologist at the University of Tennessee and President-Elect of the Society of Systematic Biologists. His research focuses on methods to study how traits have changed over time and their potential impact on other traits as well as speciation and extinction. Find him on Twitter @omearabrian and the web at http://brianomeara.info.

- **Dan Simberloff, PhD** (u/kdec940) is a leader in the field of invasion biology and the Nancy Gore Hunger Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Tennessee. He studies the patterns displayed by species introduced outside their geographic ranges, the impacts such species have on the communities they invade, and the means by which such invasions can be managed.

,askscience,"Hello, I was looking for stats on this topic, but struggled to find anything that really fit the bill. My question mostly pertains to the developed world, although I imagine the trends involved are global to varying degrees. I'm also excluding physical disability due to aging, because that seems like it obscures the overall picture (unless, I suppose, 80-year-olds today are more or less likely to be disabled than 80-year-olds a hundred years ago)

It occurred to me the other day that many of the factors that caused lifelong physical disability in the past are now largely controlled. Most infectious diseases that caused disability in children, like polio, meningitis, and mumps, are now either gone from the developed world or relatively rare. Additionally, a number of other causes of disability, like growth hormone disorders, are now routinely identified and treated in childhood.

We've also improved health and safety and environmental regulations, which means you'd think fewer people are disabled due to workplace injuries or preventable exposure to contaminants (lead, for example). Another example of a cause of disability that is decreasing in incidence are neural tube defects, due in part to the US and a few other countries introducing folate fortification.

My guess from all of this is that the number of people per 100,000 with physical disabilities is probably decreasing, as fewer people acquire disabilities and those that did decades ago pass away. Is this true? Are there countervailing trends I'm missing out here?

Most infectious diseases that caused disability in children, like polio, meningitis, and mumps, are now either gone from the developed world or relatively rare. Additionally, a number of other causes of disability, like growth hormone disorders, are now routinely identified and treated in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve also improved health and safety and environmental regulations, which means you&amp;#39;d think fewer people are disabled due to workplace injuries or preventable exposure to contaminants (lead, for example). Another example of a cause of disability that is decreasing in incidence are neural tube defects, due in part to the US and a few other countries introducing folate fortification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess from all of this is that the number of people per 100,000 with physical disabilities is probably decreasing, as fewer people acquire disabilities and those that did decades ago pass away. Is this true? Are there countervailing trends I&amp;#39;m missing out here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only asking for curiosity because this seems like a demographic trend nobody mentions if it&amp;#39;s true.&lt;/p&gt;

I am Lalasia Bialic-Murphy, a Senior Scientist in the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich and an Adjunct Research Assistant Professor at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I study the importance of species interactions and abiotic resources (e.g., soil nutrient and water) in shaping the local abundance and geographical distribution of plant populations. I am particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that drive species rarity and extinction in a changing world. I was also a field biologist for over 12 years, doing rare species management and critical habitat monitoring in Hawai'i. Understanding how on-going environmental change is affecting native ecosystems is critical for developing informed conservation efforts, and this is my passion. Ask me anything. I would also love to hear your experiences and perspectives on these topics. Let's talk!
+ [Iris Hordijk](https://twitter.com/CrowtherLab/status/1359143835117486083), Doctoral Candidate - /u/IrisHordijk
I am a third year doctoral student in the Crowther lab, ETH Zürich. My research focusses mainly on global tree species diversity and the relationship with forest functioning. I am interested in the patterns of tree species abundance, what drives species dominance and rarity, and how do dominant species influence forest productivity. Besides, I am passionate about tropical forest ecology and I am involved in a pan-tropical project on forest regeneration with fieldwork in Mexico. Ask me anything you would like to know related to academic life or my research!  
+ Niamh Robmann, Data Scientist - /u/nima-rob
After my bachelor's degree in Biology where I was mainly interested in anthropology and ecology, I decided to study bioinformatics &amp; computational biology for my master's degree.
I ended up doing my master's thesis in the Crowther lab where I was able to combine my interest in ecology and the newly learned tools and knowledge from my master's study program. Now I am working as a Data Scientist in the lab trying to support the group by adding my more data focused perspective.

I am majored in Computer Science and applied mathematics, and chose to apply my technical skills to environmental issues. So, I decided to pursue a Master 2 in Environmental sciences, because I feel very concerned by climate change. I did my Master Thesis at Crowther Lab, which enabled me to work closely with the department of Computer Science at ETH. I will start my PhD in Computer Science in September but I hope to keep close contact with Crowther Lab and its amazing members!

With a background in bioinformatics and a strong infatuation for coding, I wanted to use my skills to contribute to fighting climate change. Although there is not much fighting in my daily routine, I support projects that strive to understand global ecology and inform responsible ecosystem restoration, for example, by writing efficient code and running machine learning models. I am a feminist with a particular interest in intersectional, eco-, and trans-feminism.

Ask me about how the vaccines have been tested and evaluated, what we know about them and what we're still learning, how guidelines for vaccine prioritization have been developed and implemented, how the U.S. federal government and state governments are working to administer vaccines quickly and equitably, and anything else about COVID vaccines and vaccination programs.

After graduating summa cum laude from Yale in 1985 with a distinction in music, I spent 10 years conducting and arranging Broadway musicals in New York. I won a Loeb Award for journalism, two Webby awards, and an honorary doctorate in music. I live in Connecticut and San Francisco with my wife Nicki and our blended brood of five spectacular children.

&lt;p&gt;If this is possible would these crops be safe for human consumption or would there be issues regarding radiation and the jaggedness of regolith that would make these crops unsafe for consumption? And if so would there be feasible ways to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; the regolith so the crops grown in it would be healthy and safe for human consumption?&lt;/p&gt;

We're currently in a cold stretch - roughly 0°F, swinging a little above during the day and a little below at night. Every day, the sun hits these ice crystals on our window and melts them into round water droplets, but it's too cold for them to evaporate.

Why do they change shape as they freeze, rather than freeze as droplets? I've been thinking about it myself - I assume they start freezing on the outer surface, and water of course expands as it freezes. I'm tempted to think that the glass might be slightly warm under the droplet since it's close to the house, but this phenomenon happens on a screen as well, and in that case both sides are exposed to the cold air.

,askscience,"First,  sorry I missed the AMA (UK based so time zone issues) hopefully someone can comment. My question: We have all heard the quoted 95% for e.g Pfizer and 70% effective for Oxford vaccines.  But it looked to me like the underlying study outputs and processes make those numbers completely incomparable. For example,  Pfizer only tested to confirm  (by PCR)  symptomatic patients,  whilst Oxford tested (at least in the UK cohort) weekly regardless of symptoms,  and as a result picked up a huge number of asymptomatic infections (almost half of the UK infections seen in the study) and included those in calculating its 70% figure.  Surely this means that on a comparable basis the Pfizer efficacy would be much lower? How can we compare them?

EDIT: a number of commenters have pointed out that my question was in fact based on a misunderstanding (I think based on the UK study report alone and not the pooled data article),  and that the Oxford efficacy calculation  appears to have only looked at the symptomatic cases so they are actually more comparable than I had realised.

,askscience,"Millions of people have now been vaccinated against SARS-COV-2 and new vaccine candidates are being approved by countries around the world. Yet infection numbers and deaths continue rising worldwide, and new strains of the virus are emerging. With barely a year's worth of clinical data on protections offered by the current batch of vaccines, numerous questions remain as to just how effective these different vaccines will be in ending this pandemic.

Join us today at 2 PM ET for a discussion with vaccine and immunology experts, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We'll answer questions on how the current COVID vaccines work (and what the differences are between the different vaccines), what sort of protection the vaccine(s) offer against current, emerging and future strains of the virus, and how the various vaccine platforms used to develop the COVID vaccines can be used to fight against future diseases. Ask us anything!

,askscience,"Every simple explanation I've ever heard about how antibodies work, describes an example where the virus is ""floating around in fluid"" like either blood or some other kind of fluid, and the antibodies float around too and ""stick"" to the antigens and neutralize the virus.

But from my understanding, SARS-CoV-2 attack vector is the upper respiratory system, where it enters our body from floating droplets in our airways through the nose and mouth.  The droplets then settle on the tissue inside of our airways and the infection begins there.  Is my visualization of how that works correct?

If such is the case, the virus is initially hitting ""exterior"" cells, because it is touching the cells that line your airway, so they are hitting a ""wall"" of cells in your nose and throat and beyond that wall is just a cavity filled with air.

So how do the antibodies neutralize the virus in this situation?  If the virus is not ""inside"" our body floating around in our blood stream.

The droplets then settle on the tissue inside of our airways and the infection begins there.  Is my visualization of how that works correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If such is the case, the virus is initially hitting &amp;quot;exterior&amp;quot; cells, because it is touching the cells that line your airway, so they are hitting a &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; of cells in your nose and throat and beyond that wall is just a cavity filled with air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do the antibodies neutralize the virus in this situation?  If the virus is not &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; our body floating around in our blood stream.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious to know the mechanics of this or if I&amp;#39;m just totally wrong about how all of this works.&lt;/p&gt;

,askscience,"Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a question within these topics you weren&amp;#39;t sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt; post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &amp;quot;What would happen if...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How will the future...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If all the rules for &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; were different...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why does my...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.&lt;/p&gt;

It says:  

&gt;Based on communication principles, the maximum signal bandwidth in wireless communication is about 5% of the carrier frequency. Therefore, the higher the carrier frequency, the greater the signal bandwidth. That’s why, among the millimeter-wave frequencies, 28 GHz and 60 GHz are the most promising frequencies for 5G. The 28 GHz band can provide an available spectrum bandwidth of up to 1 GHz, while each channel in the 60 GHz band can provide an available signal bandwidth of 2 GHz (a total available spectrum of 9 GHz divided between four channels).  

I'm assuming this is in the context of frequency modulation.  

But I'm confused about the link between signal bandwidth and better speed or lower latency. Reading Wikipedia, signal bandwidth is defined as the difference between highest and lowest frequency. Why is having this being higher an advantage?

,askscience,"Thanks in advance for entertaining my very basic question. Here's what I think I know so far:

White light shines from a light source and hits the cyan and yellow pigments. The pigments reflect the wavelengths that correspond to cyan (ca 475nm) and yellow (ca 580nm) respectively, and absorb the rest. The ""cyan"" and ""yellow"" wavelengths then enter the eye.

If the above is correct, does that mean that the tristimulus values of spectral green and cyan+yellow are the same, like in the case of yellow and green+red?

Apologies if this is a dumb question. I think my confusion comes in part from trying to figure how additive and subtractive color models fit in the real world. Would it be accurate to say that subtractive color is a part of physical reality, while additive color exists only as a part of human perception?

Bonus question: I understand that in reality a blue object does reflect other wavelengths besides ""blue"" ones, albeit at a lower intensity.

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

In this case, the thermal velocity would be zero, but the Fermi velocity can get up near a percent of the speed of light (graphene for example). Clearly this is a huge discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why do we say electron speed is governed by kT instead of the Fermi level?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a quantum vs classical issue as pointed out.  Dense systems of electrons should go by Fermi energy, sparse systems can use kT.&lt;/p&gt;

The US, the UK and Israel have all had very dramatic reductions in the number of lab confirmed cases recently.  The US and the UK in particular have seen their numbers decline very steadily since about January 10, and that would suggest that the number of infections started to drop for both of them by about January 1 (given the typical lag between infections and when they turn up in lab confirmed results).

Israel's drop in numbers has been shorter, only about a week, but it has been very dramatic. Such sharp drops are usually due to results being reported late, but in this case the sharp decline has been apparent for over a week now - it's real. Israel has reportedly given the first does of the Pfizer vaccine to at least 37% of their population and their high vaccination rate is probably what is causing this sharp reduction for them.

The UK has been in a fairly strict lockdown for weeks now, and that is the most likely explanation for their rapid and steady drop in lab confirmed numbers.

But the US has seen a drop in daily lab confirmed numbers very similar to the UK's.  For when the drop started, it's steepness and for how long it's been going on. 

I can't find any reason for why the US's numbers are dropping so quickly. They're vaccination rate isn't that high.  They haven't implemented any new strict lockdowns (a football game I listened to for a few minutes last night mentioned that there were only 17,000 fans there but that it was still nearly as loud as when it's at it's 70,000 capacity - that is not a lockdown). 

What happened around January 1 that could explain the USA's rapid and sustained decline in daily lab confirmed cases?

How did sex evolve when two organisms that needed complimentary sex mechanisms/DNA-combining systems had to mutate that at the same time and place?

,askscience,"For pentane vs pentanol, for example, this is the complete combustion (balanced to have equal number of moles of pentanol and pentane):

Pentanol: 2 C2H11OH (l) +15 O2 (g) → 10 CO2 (g)+ 12 H2O (g)+ energy

Pentane: 2 C5H12 (l) + 16 O2 (g)→ 10 CO2 (g)+ 12 H2O (g)+ energy

(Formula for enthalpy of combustion: bonds broken - bonds formed) (I think)

So since the products are the same (bond formed), then the change is at the bonds broken. From my understanding, pentane (higher enthalpy of combustion) should have less energy ""wasted"" in breaking bonds, as pentane's reactants should have weaker (or less) bonds.

However pentane's combustion has one extra O2 bond, so does that mean that pentanol's bonds are so much stronger (because of the OH) than pentane's to the point where even with the extra O2 molecule it takes more energy to break the bonds of pentanol's combustion rather than the bonds of pentanol's reaction?

I know that there are also incomplete combustions, but my teacher told me that just by looking at the complete combustion I should see why pentane has a higher enthalpy.

&lt;p&gt;Pentanol: 2 C2H11OH (l) +15 O2 (g) → 10 CO2 (g)+ 12 H2O (g)+ energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pentane: 2 C5H12 (l) + 16 O2 (g)→ 10 CO2 (g)+ 12 H2O (g)+ energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Formula for enthalpy of combustion: bonds broken - bonds formed) (I think)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So since the products are the same (bond formed), then the change is at the bonds broken. From my understanding, pentane (higher enthalpy of combustion) should have less energy &amp;quot;wasted&amp;quot; in breaking bonds, as pentane&amp;#39;s reactants should have weaker (or less) bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However pentane&amp;#39;s combustion has one extra O2 bond, so does that mean that pentanol&amp;#39;s bonds are so much stronger (because of the OH) than pentane&amp;#39;s to the point where even with the extra O2 molecule it takes more energy to break the bonds of pentanol&amp;#39;s combustion rather than the bonds of pentanol&amp;#39;s reaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that there are also incomplete combustions, but my teacher told me that just by looking at the complete combustion I should see why pentane has a higher enthalpy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA hasn’t made a decision on accepting/refusing the use of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 88% of trial patients were latin which are thought to be more severely affected by Lupus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doesn’t this damage the study as 12% being white or black may be to small to get a statistical significance. &lt;/p&gt;

My colleagues and I (all bio-lab people) are a bit stumped on this bit. We understand that the Covid vaccine carries mRNA in a lipid membrane, that is then carried into cells and translated into protein. Then this protein is presented to the immune system (How though? On the cellular membrane, or through MHC?)  
  
We also understand that the immune system recognizes this as foreign and thus will develop antibodies. What we don't quite get is why the immune system (Through for instance CD8 Tcells) doesn't start wiping out all the ""infected"" human cells. To my knowledge, none of the vaccines noted any cell death as a result of jab. 
I had some suggestions, but I don't really got a solid answer for this either.  
- Is the mRNA degraded by the time the CD8 cells are active, so that the ""infected"" cells are cured again?  
- Are there perhaps cytokines or other markers absent in an ""infection"" caused by a RNA vaccine that prevent T-cell killing?

However, they use a mouse model that has this molecule knocked out, and reintroduce it via intracerebroventricular injection. The IP ab treatment manages to ameliorate the loss of BBB integrity.

This suggest that:

1) the antibody goes from the peritoneal cavity into circulation and reaches the BBB. How does this work? I could see drugs being passively transported into the surrounding vasculature, but I don't see it'd work for antibodies

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hwnhe2/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

,askscience,"**TL;DR:** Last week was British Science Week! We are here to answer any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.

Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:** CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 97)!

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however the people standing by to answer comments are:

+ Vic Leverett OBE: 40 years' engineering experience with previous director-level positions Europe's largest defence/engineering companies. Honoured by The Queen with an OBE for services to engineering and defence.
+ Professor David Humber: 30 years' experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.
+ David Whyte: Technologist and Chartered Engineer with 10 years' Research and Deployment experience and 15 international patents across a wide range of technologies.
+ Amy Knight: Science teacher and artist experienced in art/science collaborations with organisations like Soapbox Science and The Royal Society; her work has been featured at the Tate Modern's ""Tate Exchange"".
+ Anthony McQuiggan: 10 years of engineering experience and 30 years as a serial entrepreneur having built a number of very successful start-up SME technology companies in the UK, Japan and the USA.
+ Roger Pittock: 36 years' experience in electronics, software, mechanical, electrical, process engineering, and safety systems. Avid supporter of the Consumers' Association, currently serving on their Council.
+ Adam Wood - President of CSES: Chartered Engineer with over 12 years' experience in electronics, software and systems engineering, working in the medical / healthcare, transport and aerospace industries.

**What intrigues you about pi? Our experts are here to answer your questions.** Pi has enthralled humanity with questions like:

- How do we know pi is [never-ending and non-repeating](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/maths/pi_irrational)?

- Would pi still be irrational in [number systems that aren't base 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/maths/pi_base10)?

- How can an irrational number represent a real-world relationship like that [between a circumference and diameter](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/maths/pi_irrational_real_world)?

,askscience,"Obviously planets orbit the sun on nearly perfect keplerian orbits, I'm not questioning that. My question is in the fine details:

There's something that was bugging me about orbital mechanics with 3+ bodies: for instance, the ISS is orbiting the Earth in a nice round orbit around its center of mass: but the Moon is also orbiting the Earth in such a way that their barycenter is offset by a good 3000km. Obviously the Moon also pulls on the ISS, but somehow it doesn't seem to affect the point it orbits around. On the other hand, an object orbiting around a close binary system will orbit their center of mass, and not either of the two, which is the opposite result.

Of course those are extreme cases, but they made me raise the question of less extreme ones: Jupiter offsets the solar system's center so much it can come out of the Sun. Does Saturn orbit that point, or does it orbit the Sun still? What about Mars, or the asteroid belt? **Is there a way to know which point of space an object can be best said to orbit?**

My intuition would tell me that the equivalent mass that governs the shape and speed of the orbit is one at the center of mass of all bodies **within** that orbit (eg the Sun + all inner planets and objects), with no net change to that from outer objects, which is the best way I could think of to reconcile the two extreme cases and it also seems coherent with Gauss' law. Is that inuition correct?

For instance, I'd see Mercury as orbiting the Sun, with not net influence from any other object apart from perturbations. But does the orbit of Venus accelerate in such a way that it's as if the mass of Mercury was added to that of the Sun? In other words, is it more correct to consider Mercury as simply perturbing Venus' orbit around the Sun, or as increasing the effective mass and position of the Sun by its own mass, or perhaps by a different amount depending on how close it is to the orbit of Venus? Or am I completely wrong going down this track?
