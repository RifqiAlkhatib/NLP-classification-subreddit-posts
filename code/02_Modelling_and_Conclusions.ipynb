    "### Further Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and foremost improvement would be, of course, to gather more data. Reddit API's limitations of 1000 posts constrains us to a limited dataset. Furthermore, the timespan of posts is also constrained and the data may thus be affected by certain events that do not consistently happen. For instance, our model showed us that the main features that predicted `r/AskScience` were related to Covid 19. However, this was definitely not the case before the year 2020, and perhaps our model would perform very differently if given the subreddit data for a much longer time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also try and incorporate more semantic concepts into our model such as a measure of sentiment analysis to help add another feature to classify posts. As shown above, solely relying on a bag-of-words model leads to some weaknesses in the model when it cannot detect underlying implications or semantics of a post."

    "## Conclusions & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our problem statement in the beginning, we have successfully created an effective classification model using NLP techniques. Our final model incorporating the `Tfidf Vectorizer` and the `Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier` delivered great results in terms of classifying posts correctly, indicating high predictive performance. The model was also good for inference, as we were able to extract the feature importances from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the actual predictions may not provide much value to Reddit moderators (since the posts by default have to belong to a subreddit), the classification probabilities and feature importances can be helpful for moderators of these subreddits to look at the underlying characteristics of posts. They can use these inferences to shape their moderation policies and influence the direction of the subreddit. For example, the `r/AskScience` moderators could discover that Covid-19 posts are becoming too prevalent in the subreddit and may want to limit such posts so that the other topics are not drowned out, thus preserving their identity as a subreddit for all forms of science, not just for viruses and immunology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential use for our model would be to help moderators understand the underlying themes and characteristics of the members in the subreddit. Although it may not be as useful for this project, since the identities of the subreddits (`r/AskScience` & `r/AskSocialScience`) are quite clear for all, the same NLP processes could be applied to other subreddits which may not have such a distinct identity. Moderators could discover frequent and/or important terms from the model that help them understand the members' interests, then organise events like AMA's to boost their engagement with the community."
